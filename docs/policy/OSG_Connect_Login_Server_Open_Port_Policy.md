# 1 Policy Statement
In order to provide safe and trustworthy services, the OSG Infrastructure team employs host-based firewall rules on all OSG Connect login hosts to block inbound network traffic not explicitly approved by the OSG. By default, users are not permitted to run network services such as file servers from their accounts on these hosts.  

Users or Collaborations who need services on login servers requiring open ports in support of their scientific workflows should send a request to support@osgconnect.net. 

The OSG will perform routine port scans and auditing of running services to verify compliance with this policy.
