# OSG-SEC-2021-12-16 Vulnerability in golang/Singularity

Dear OSG Security Contacts,

A security vulnerability in golang has been announced that can potentially lead to a vulnerability in singularity.  The OSG security team considers the risk of this vulnerability to be MODERATE.

## IMPACTED VERSIONS:

Any version of singularity compiled using golang 1.16.11 or older or using 1.17 through 1.17.4 is impacted. This includes EPEL singularity rpms 3.8.5-1 or earlier.

## WHAT ARE THE VULNERABILITIES:

Prior to golang 1.16.12 and 1.17.5, the syscall.ForkExec function had a flaw that can result in output for one file descriptor to be redirected to another under conditions of running out of file descriptors [1].  Singularity uses that library call, so it is potentially affected [2].  There is no specific known exploit at this time, but especially for setuid-root installations it is better to ensure that a newly compiled version is installed.

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:

Upgrade to a version of singularity compiled with the newer golang.  For those using the EPEL rpms, upgrade to version 3.8.5-2 which is currently in epel-testing and should be promoted to epel by the end of next week.
