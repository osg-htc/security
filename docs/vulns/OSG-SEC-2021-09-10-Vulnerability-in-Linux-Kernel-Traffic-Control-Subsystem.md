# OSG-SEC-2021-09-10 Vulnerability in Linux Kernel Traffic Control Subsystem

Dear OSG Security Contacts,

A use-after-free vulnerability (CVE-2021-3715) has been identified in the Linux kernel Traffic Control networking subsystem.  OSG Security Team considers this vulnerability to be of HIGH severity if unprivileged_network_namespaces are not disabled [4].

## IMPACTED VERSIONS:

All systems running RHEL 7 and 8 or derivatives [1], Debian systems [2], and Ubuntu systems [3] may be vulnerable.

## WHAT ARE THE VULNERABILITIES:

A flaw was found in the "Routing decision" classifier in the Linux kernel's Traffic Control networking subsystem in the way it handled changing of classification filters, leading to a use-after-free condition. This flaw allows unprivileged local users to escalate their privileges on the system [1].

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:

Sites and VOs should update their systems to a patched version as soon as it becomes available and disable unprivileged_network_namespaces if not specifically required.

Mitigation of this vulnerability is possible by disabling unprivileged_network_namespaces. In general unprivileged_network_namespaces should be disabled if they are not required [4].

Note that this mitigation is available for Singularity as enabling unprivileged_network_namespaces is not required for Singularity.  However, they may be required for other software packages or system services on RHEL 8 and CentOS8, please see reference [4] below for more information.
