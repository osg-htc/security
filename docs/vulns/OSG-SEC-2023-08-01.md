# OSG-SEC-2023-08-01 MEDIUM OpenJDK TLS vulnerability

Dear OSG Security Contacts,

It was discovered that the TLS implementation in the JSSE component of OpenJDK did not correctly handle half-duplex connections during TLS handshake. A remote attacker could use this flaw to affect confidentiality or integrity of a TLS connection (CVE-2023-21930)  [1].

## IMPACTED VERSIONS:

All supported versions of RHEL and derived distributions [2].

RHEL packages affected:

java-11-openjdk

java-17-openjdk

java-1.8.0-openjdk

java-1.8.0-ibm

## WHAT ARE THE VULNERABILITIES:

This is described as a difficult to exploit vulnerability that allows an unauthenticated attacker with network access via TLS to compromise Oracle Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized creation, deletion or modification access to critical data or all Oracle Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition accessible data as well as unauthorized access to critical data or complete access to all Oracle Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition accessible data [3].

Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability can also be exploited by using APIs in the specified Component, e.g., through a web service which supplies data to the APIs [3].

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:

Update the relevant OpenJDK packages installed on your Linux systems.
