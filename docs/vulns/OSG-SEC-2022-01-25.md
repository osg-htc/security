# OSG-SEC-2022-01-25 CRITICAL heap buffer overflow vulnerability in Linux kernel for RHEL 8 and derivatives

Dear OSG Security Contacts,

A heap buffer overflow has been found in the Linux kernel for RHEL 8 and derivative operating systems.  Exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an unprivileged user to elevate privileges on the system [1][2].

## IMPACTED VERSIONS:
RHEL 8 systems and derivatives running containers and/or with user namespaces enabled.

## WHAT ARE THE VULNERABILITIES:
A heap-based buffer overflow flaw in the way the legacy_parse_param function in the Filesystem Context functionality of the Linux kernel verified the supplied parameters length which could be used for privilege escalation.

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
Update to a fixed kernel version when available for your distribution. [3][4][5]

## MITIGATIONS
On systems not running containers, you can disable user namespaces by setting user.max_user_namespaces to 0 [1]:
RHEL 8:
echo "user.max_user_namespaces=0" \
    > /etc/sysctl.d/userns.conf
sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/userns.conf

CentOS 8:
echo "user.max_user_namespaces = 0" \
    > /etc/sysctl.d/90-max_user_namespaces.conf
sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/90-max_user_namespaces.conf
