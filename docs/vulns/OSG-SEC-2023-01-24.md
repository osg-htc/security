# OSG-SEC-2023-01-24 HIGH sudoedit privilege escalation

Dear OSG Security Contacts,

A vulnerability was found in the sudo package (CVE-2023-22809) [8]. An exposure in how sudoedit handles user-provided environment variables can lead to arbitrary file writing with privileges of the RunAs user (usually root) [7].

## IMPACTED VERSIONS:

Sudo versions 1.8.0 through 1.9.12.p1

## WHAT ARE THE VULNERABILITIES:

In Sudo, before 1.9.12p2, the sudoedit (aka -e) feature mishandles extra arguments passed in the user-provided environment variables (SUDO_EDITOR, VISUAL, and EDITOR), allowing a local attacker to append arbitrary entries to the list of files to process. This can lead to privilege escalation. The problem exists because a user-specified editor may contain a "--" argument that defeats a protection mechanism, e.g., an EDITOR='vim -- /path/to/extra/file' value.

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:

Install the updated sudo packages for your systems. Patched packages are available for all RHEL versions and most other major distributions.

Alternatively, the problem may be mitigated[8]. It is possible to prevent a user-specified editor from being used by sudoedit by adding the following line to the sudoers file:

  Defaults!sudoedit    env_delete+="SUDO_EDITOR VISUAL EDITOR"

To restrict the editor when editing specific files, a Cmnd_Alias can be used, for example:

  Cmnd_Alias              EDIT_MOTD = sudoedit /etc/motd
  Defaults!EDIT_MOTD      env_delete+="SUDO_EDITOR VISUAL EDITOR"
  user                    ALL = EDIT_MOTD

Even if applying the mitigation, the affected packages should still be updated as soon as possible.
