# OSG-SEC-2023-07-28 HIGH OpenSSH remote code execution

Dear OSG Security Contacts,

A remote code execution vulnerability has been discovered in OpenSSH's forwarded ssh-agent. This vulnerability allows a remote attacker to potentially execute arbitrary commands on vulnerable OpenSSH's forwarded ssh-agent. [1] [2]

## IMPACTED VERSIONS:

OpenSSH 5.5 - 9.3p1 (inclusive)  [3]

## WHAT ARE THE VULNERABILITIES:

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on vulnerable OpenSSH forwarded ssh-agent. It occurs where specific libraries loaded via ssh-agent(1)'s PKCS#11 support could be abused to achieve remote code execution via a forwarded agent socket if the following conditions are met: [3]

* Exploitation requires the presence of specific libraries on
  the victim system.

* Remote exploitation requires that the agent was forwarded
  to an attacker-controlled system.


## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:

Upgrade to OpenSSH when updates are available for your Linux distributions. Presently there are no patched packages available for RHEL 6, 7, 8, or 9 based distributions [4].

A patched version of the OpenSSH project source, 9.3p2, is available from the OpenSSH project if you want to build your own binaries from source. [3]

The vulnerability can be mitigated by starting ssh-agent with an empty PKCS#11/FIDO allowlist (ssh-agent -P "") or by configuring an allowlist that contains only specific provider libraries. [3]
