Dear OSG Security Contacts,

A CRITICAL vulnerability has been identified in Linux Kernel versions 5.8 and higher, and a proof-of-concept exploit has been published for Debian and reported for Ubuntu [1][2]. Sites running affected hosts should update to a patched version immediately.

## IMPACTED VERSIONS:
Systems running Ubuntu or Debian with Linux Kernel 5.8 or higher. RHEL 8 and derivatives are not susceptible to the published proof-of-concept [3], but may be vulnerable to other undisclosed exploitation methods in the future and should be patched as well.

Kernel version can be checked with “uname -r”.

RHEL 7 and derivatives are not affected [3].

## WHAT ARE THE VULNERABILITIES:
An exploit was introduced in Linux Kernel version 5.8 which may allow the writing of arbitrary data to arbitrary files even if they are O_RDONLY, immutable, or on MS_RDONLY filesystems [1]. A usable exploit for this vulnerability has already been published for Debian systems and reported for Ubuntu systems [1][2].

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
Hosts running affected versions of Linux should be updated as soon as possible, especially hosts running Debian [4] and Ubuntu [5].

The vulnerability is fixed in kernel versions 5.16.11, 5.15.25, and 5.10.102 [1].
