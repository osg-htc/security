# OSG-SEC-2022-10-04 MEDIUM DNS BIND memory leaks

Dear OSG Security Contacts,

The DNSSEC verification code for the ECDSA algorithm leaks memory when there is a signature length mismatch, and can crash the DNS server daemon. Additional details are covered in CVE-2022-38177. [1]

## IMPACTED VERSIONS:

BIND 9.8.4 -> 9.16.32

## WHAT ARE THE VULNERABILITIES:

By spoofing the target resolver with responses that have a malformed ECDSA signature, an attacker can trigger a small memory leak. It is possible to gradually erode available memory to the point where 'named' crashes for lack of resources, resulting in a denial of service attack for DNS lookups made against the crashed server. [7]  The risk is negligible for systems not using BIND to run a DNS server. If, however, you are using 'named' to run a DNS server then the impact could be a significant but temporary interruption of any services relying on DNS lookups.

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:

Update affected systems as patches become available and make sure relevant daemons are restarted.
