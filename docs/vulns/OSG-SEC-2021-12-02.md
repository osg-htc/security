# OSG-SEC-2021-12-02 CRITICAL Severity RCE Vulnerability in NSS

Dear OSG Security Contacts,

A remote code execution flaw was found in the way NSS verifies certificates. This flaw allows an attacker posing as an SSL/TLS server to trigger this issue in a client application compiled with NSS when it tries to initiate an SSL/TLS connection. The highest threat to this vulnerability is confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability. The OSG Security Team considers this vulnerability to be of CRITICAL severity.

## IMPACTED VERSIONS
Any software using the Network Security Services (NSS) libraries, including but not limited to:
CentOS 7, 8, and other RHEL Derivatives
Red Hat Virtualization 4
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 Extended Lifecycle Support
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4

## WHAT ARE THE VULNERABILITIES
CVE-2021-43527 [1]

Red Hat provided this information:
A remote code execution flaw was found in the way NSS verifies certificates. This flaw allows an attacker posing as an SSL/TLS server to trigger this issue in a client application compiled with NSS when it tries to initiate an SSL/TLS connection. Similarly, a server application compiled with NSS, which processes client certificates, can receive a malicious certificate via a client, triggering the flaw. The highest threat to this vulnerability is confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO
Update the NSS library packages and restart software like Firefox that uses them. Redhat has released fixes and other vendors will be releasing updates shortly.
