# OSG-SEC-2025-09-11 CRITICAL linux-kernel: CRITICAL risk vulnerability concerning Linux kernel allowing local privilege escalation,CVE-2025-38352

Dear OSG Security Contacts,

A race condition was found in the Linux kernel’s POSIX CPU timer handling, where handle_posix_cpu_timers() may run concurrently with posix_cpu_timer_del() on an exiting task which could result in use-after-free scenarios. An attacker with local user access could use this flaw to crash or escalate their privileges on a system. Also there is a known exploit. 

Exploitation of this flaw could allow an attacker with local user access to:
Cause a denial of service by crashing the kernel.
Potentially escalate privileges to root



## IMPACTED VERSIONS:

RHEL 7ELS,8,9,10 and derivatives.

## WHAT ARE THE VULNERABILITIES:
The Linux kernel has a bug in the way it handles POSIX CPU timers. Two parts of the kernel (handle_posix_cpu_timers() and posix_cpu_timer_del()) can sometimes run at the same time when a process is exiting.
This causes a race condition — one part of the kernel thinks memory is still in use, while the other part has already freed it. That creates a use-after-free bug.
## Attack Preconditions:
Any valid, unprivileged user account.
The kernel must have POSIX timers enabled (CONFIG_POSIX_TIMERS=y).
Race Condition Trigger:The attacker needs to reliably trigger the timing window where memory is freed but still in use.
Kernels with CONFIG_POSIX_CPU_TIMERS_TASK_WORK=y reduce the race window, but are still patched for defense-in-depth.
## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:

Upgrade to secure packages as they become available.
