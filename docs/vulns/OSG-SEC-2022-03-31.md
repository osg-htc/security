# OSG-SEC-2022-03-31 CRITICAL Expat XML parser arbitrary code execution vulnerability

Dear OSG Security Contacts,

Vulnerabilities have been found concerning the expat XML parser, including two which may lead to arbitrary code execution[1][2][3].  The expat XML parser is a library, written in C, which is a dependency for various other software, including VOMS server and client.

## IMPACTED VERSIONS:

xmltok_impl.c in Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.5

## WHAT ARE THE VULNERABILITIES:

xmltok_impl.c in Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.5 lacks certain validation of encoding, such as checks for whether a UTF-8 character is valid in a certain context. xmlparse.c in Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.5 allows attackers to insert namespace-separator characters into namespace URIs.

Of principal concern are VOMS client and server packages, as well as HTCondor which also utilizes the VOMS library.

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:

Sites running software which is dependent on expat should update urgently, including those running a VOMS server or client.  They should then restart the updated service [4][5][6].
