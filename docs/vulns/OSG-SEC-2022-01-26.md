# OSG-SEC-2022-01-26 CRITICAL local privilege escalation in polkit's pkexec

Dear OSG Security Contacts,

A local privilege escalation in polkit's [1] pkexec has been discovered [2]. Polkit's pkexec is a setuid root program that's installed by default on every major Linux distribution. Exploitation of this vulnerability allows an unprivileged user to elevate their privileges to root on the system [3]. Due to the widespread nature and the ease of exploitability, the OSG security team has categorized this as a CRITICAL severity vulnerability.

## IMPACTED VERSIONS:
All major Linux distributions [4][5][6].

## WHAT ARE THE VULNERABILITIES:
Polkit (formerly PolicyKit) is a component for controlling system-wide
privileges in Unix-like operating systems.

- any unprivileged local user can exploit this vulnerability to obtain
  full root privileges;

- although this vulnerability is technically a memory corruption, it is
  exploitable instantly, reliably, in an architecture-independent way;

- and it is exploitable even if the polkit daemon itself is not running.

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
Update to a patched version of polkit when available for your distribution [4][5][6].

## MITIGATIONS
If no patches are available for your operating system, you can remove the setuid bit from the pkexec executable as a temporary mitigation with the following command:

chmod 0755 /usr/bin/pkexec
