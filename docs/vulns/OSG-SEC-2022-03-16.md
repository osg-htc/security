# OSG-SEC-2022-03-16 HIGH Severity DOS Vulnerability in OpenSSL

Dear OSG Security Contacts,

A function in OpenSSL contains a bug that can be used by attackers to cause an infinite loop, resulting in a denial-of-service (DOS) attack against vulnerable hosts.

## IMPACTED VERSIONS:
This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.0, 1.1.1 and 3.0.

## WHAT ARE THE VULNERABILITIES:
The BN_mod_sqrt() function, which computes a modular square root, contains
a bug that can cause it to loop forever for non-prime moduli. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has invalid explicit curve parameters. [1]

Vulnerable situations include:
 - TLS clients consuming server certificates
 - TLS servers consuming client certificates
 - Hosting providers taking certificates or private keys from customers
 - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from subscribers
 - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
Update to a patched version of OpenSSL

- (OpenSSL 1.0.2) This version is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. Extended support to upgrade to 1.0.2zd is available for premium support customers:
https://www.openssl.org/support/contracts.html. Other users should upgrade to 1.1.1n or 3.0.2.

- (OpenSSL 1.1.0) This version is out of support and no longer receiving updates of any kind. Users should upgrade to 1.1.1n or 3.0.2. 

- (OpenSSL 1.1.1) Users should upgrade to 1.1.1n

- (OpenSSL 3.0) Users should upgrade to 3.0.2
