After this date, new certificates from the CILogon OSG CA cannot be requested and therefore will no longer be issued. All certificates issued by CILogon OSG CA will continue to work until their expiration dates. The CILogon OSG CA will remain in the IGTF distribution until July 2019. Starting June 2016, the CILogon OSG CA is issuing certificates for users, hosts and services for OSG. The CILogon OSG CA is jointly operated with XSEDE. Combined with OSG Registration Authority and the OSG Information Management System, the CILogon OSG CA will provide the essential certificate services to the OSG community, including the personal, host and service certificates. The transition from DigiCert CA to CILogon OSG CA was completed on May 31st, 2016. All user, host and service certificates are issued by CILogon OSG CA. All OSG Virtual Organizations (VOs) were transitioned successfully to CILogon OSG CA. All certificates issued by DigiCert CA will continue to work until its expiration date What are we using from CILogon? Note, we are not using CILogon Basic CA. We are using CILogon HSM which is completely different from CILogon Basic. Note that CILogon has 4 different backend services and they are all different, we are using HSM. If you have a CILogon Basic certificate, you can continue to use that, but when you get a new certificate from OSG, you will get a CILogon HSM, not a CILogon Basic one, so it will be different. How do I get user certificates? How do I get host or server certificates? Frequently Asked Questions Does this transition mean that my local site will pay for certificates? No. No changes to current process with regard to fees. What does this transition mean for the end user? What does the end user need to do to get new certificates? Once end users' certificates are near expiring, they go to OIM to get a new certificate. The process is the same, but the distinguished name (DN) in the certifcate will be the new provider instead of DigiCert. Users will need to register their new DN with whatever services they access: DocDB?, twiki, etc. Note, the transition team will provide a script to automatically register the new DN with VOMS. I am a GridAdmin/RA Agent. Will I have the same privileges? If so, will you require anything from my home institution? Yes, you will continue to act as a GridAdmin. Your home institution is not required to do anything for you to obtain this privilege. Will the new certificates be trusted by browsers so we don't get all sorts of warnings popping up? Since the previous one was commercial, they paid money to be accepted by browsers.

Also do NOT forget to report security incidents to your local/home organization's incident response team. Please promptly report security incidents involving OSG resources via email to security@osg-htc.org . Please include the following information in your report: Your name, email address, phone number. A description of the incident, including time(s), systems and user accounts involved, and any related event. What is your affiliation with the OSG? Which Virtual Organization are you a member of? Did this incident occur on a Site machine or on a VO machine or on your personal computer? Please provide detailed information (names, IPs, URLs, etc.) if you have Do you think your grid identity (certificate and/or proxy) is compromised? Any additional comments or questions you have What to do after an incident is reported Note If you have not reported the incident to your local security team AND the OSG security team, report the incident now. Note You will first want to notify your local security contacts. The local security contacts will help with hands-on examination. Then, make sure to report the incident to OSG. Compromised machine If it is initially determined that the machine has been compromised, then here are a couple of steps to take: Note Do not turn the machine off. There may be processes and/or live data that an incident responder may want to obtain on the machine. Note Do not delete any files. Do not wipe off and re-install the system. Get the machine off the network so it cannot do any more damage. The easiest way to do this will be to unplug the network cable from the machine. If this is a remote machine, or you are not sure where the machine is, then you will likely need to contact the local security or networking group and have them block the machine at the border or at the network jack. Take notes including timestamps of actions performed while investigating and isolating the machine. Compromised account If you have determined that this incident has a compromised account(s) then you should follow below two steps: Banning a user Revoking a certificate Whether you are an end user and have discovered that your certificate was compromised, or a system administrator who needs to revoke one or many certificates that were discovered to be compromised. End user revoking a certificate If you think that your certificate has been compromised in any way then it is the safest bet to go ahead and revoke your certificate and get a new one. Using the web browser where your certificate and private key are installed, go to the OIM interface , choose the appropriate type of certificate and click on the Search button. Enter details as to why the certificate is being revoked and click on the Revoke button. You can get a new one afterward from the same location. There are currently no options to revoke a certificate from the command line. Getting a new user certificate . System administrator revoking a certificate(s) If you are a system administrator and have discovered that one (or more) user certificates on your system have been compromised then you will need to have these certificates revoked. Users can revoke their own certificates, but only a Registration Authority Agent (RAA) for a Certificate Authority (CA) can revoke a certificate not owned by them. So you will need to determine what CA's the certificates on your system belong to and then contact a RAA for that CA and have them revoke the certificates for you. Additional steps If you are tasked with doing the forensic analysis, there are additional steps you can take. However, if an administrator or security engineer is going to be looking into the incident then you should leave the basic forensic analysis to them to insure that no data is destroyed during the investigation.","title":"Incident Discovery Reporting"},{"location":"IncidentDiscoveryReporting/#incident-discovery-and-reporting","text":"","title":"Incident Discovery and Reporting"},{"location":"IncidentDiscoveryReporting/#reporting-a-problem","text":"If you suspect a security problem, please report it immediately .

The OSG has traditionally included a handful of CAs in addition to the IGTF-Classic Certificate Authorities (CAs) for signing host certificates. These CAs often rely on manual, multi-step processes for signing certificates that add administrative overhead. Many modern operational environments would like to spin up hosts in response to changing user demand but the manual process often proves to be too slow for certificate procurement and revocation. Let\u2019s Encrypt is an automated CA system that relies on a FQDN\u2019s authoritative DNS records to identify and confirm a host\u2019s identity. Let\u2019s Encrypt also provides short-lived certificates in a secure manner with a minimum of overhead and automated renewal. Unlike the IGTF-Classic CAs, certificates from Let\u2019s Encrypt will be recognized by your browser and OS by default. Let\u2019s Encrypt, however, does not confirm the organization that is running the host in the same manner as the IGTF-Classic CAs; we believe the additional IGTF checks are redundant with the registration and service discovery steps done on the OSG. OSG has separate registration procedures for services on the OSG that verifies the organizations; no access is given solely based on the possession of a host certificate. For more details please consult the OSG Information Security Officer's position paper on the Let's Encrypt CA for Host Certificate Signing. This is the upcoming change likely to be most relevant to security contacts during the migration. For more details on the migration plan please consult the Service Migration Plan document .","title":"Including Let\u2019s Encrypt signing certificate in OSG CA bundle"},{"location":"OSGCertificateService/","text":"OSG Certificate Service Warning OSG CA stopped issuing certificates on May 31st, 2018.

Other PGP Clients Enigmail OpenPGP plugin for Thunderbird The OpenPGP plugin for Thunderbird provides a well integrated user interface for key management and email signing and verification that uses GnuPG underneath. Signing an S/MIME message with your certificate The following is a command line instruction on how to sign an email with your certificate. Instructions for web clients is below. [user@client ~]$ openssl smime -sign -signer ~/.globus/usercert.pem -inkey ~/.globus/userkey.pem -in message.txt | mail -s \"email subject\" person@example.com message.txt - body of the email message ~/.globus/usercert.pem, userkey.pem - your personal grid certificate person@example.com - address where email is to be sent Alternatively, you can send message.txt as an attachment with nearly any email client. It generally works better to send the signed file as an attachment rather than copying it into the body of the message because various email clients and particularly web interfaces to email often modify the message body and therefore break the digital signature. Email client instructions With the diversity of different web and various mail clients it is difficult to keep instructions up-to-date on how to deal with certificates. So below we link to a few different sites that deal in X509 certificates and have good instructions on signing emails, as well as other topics dealing with certificates. Thawte's how to sign an email instructions. Verisign certificate instructions. Verifying an S/MIME signed message [user@client ~]$ openssl smime -verify -in message.txt -CApath $X509_CERT_DIR -signer sendercert.pem [user@client ~]$ openssl x509 -in sendercert.pem -noout -subject -email -serial -dates message.txt - body of email message received note that the line beginning \"Content-Type\" and including 'boundary=\"---' must be a single line and not get broken or wrapped. sendercert.pem - the certificate used by the sender to sign the message, is extracted with the openssl smime command openssl x5091 command above will display the subject, email address, serial number and validity dates of the signer's certificate","title":"SecureEmail"},{"location":"SecureEmail/#secure-email-in-osg","text":"","title":"Secure Email in OSG"},{"location":"SecureEmail/#about-this-document","text":"This document covers using secure email when communicating with the OSG security team.

Security Awareness OSG embraces Integrated Security Management Principles , where everyone is responsible for the security. Everyone is obliged to: work diligently follow the OSG controls be proactive feed into process Our goal is to prevent the unacceptable security risks to OSG. Risk is a function of threat and vulnerability. R(Threat, Vulnerability). A threat that has no existing vulnerability at OSG does not constitute a risk; a vulnerability without any existing threat does not constitute a risk. A system with no risks can only happen when it is entirely isolated from the outside world and under tight security controls. OSG's goal is not to create a \"perfect\" system but prevent unacceptable risks. The impact of a risk is proportional to the loss caused by the risk. A risk with very small likelihood and very large loss potential has a higher impact than a risk with higher likelihood but a much smaller loss. OSG risk assessment evaluates the risks to OSG core services/assets and classifies their impacts. For example, an acceptable risk with LOW impact: A security event has LOW risk if it occurs less than 10 times per year AND does not disrupt the perception of the OSG as a reliable computational facility AND no single occurrence of the event disables substantially all of OSG\u2019s operational Compute Element service for more than two days.\u201d The OSG security plan describes the security controls (activities, audits, checks, etc) that should be followed to minimize the risks.

A VO, site or support center has their own security officers and are responsible for providing their own security. For example, each VO and site is expected to have their security policies stated and implemented. OSG does not develop policies or implement them on its member's behalf. The OSG security team helps OSG members by providing examples, templates, services and tools; however, the ultimate responsibility lies with the member entity to ensure its security. Each VO and site is accountable for its actions in the OSG. They are expected to follow and comply with the OSG policies. A VO is responsible for the behavior of its members. OSG provides access to users due to their membership with a VO and OSG's trust in that VO. When users violates OSG policies, OSG holds the corrsponding VO responsible and may even bar that VO from OSG membership. therefore, it is a VO's responsibility to ensure that their users understand VO and OSG policies when they join the VO.

First, our (OSG security team) responsibilities for sites Our goal is to minimize disruptions caused by attacks or security problems so that your work is more effective and the computational resources are more productive. We recognize that participating in and operating grid resources and infrastructure is a learning experience for all of us. In addition to keeping up with vulnerabilities discovered with the grid middleware and having a security process intended to reduce the likelihood that security problems cause a significant disruption to the productive use of the resources, we strive to provide helpful information and assistance to site administrators (and other grid participants). We are sure that the information provided to site administrators and grid users is incomplete and could be greatly improved. We hope (and would like) that site administrators (and others) that have questions will ask. And, one of the main reasons that documentation is maintained on the TWIKI is so that everyone can be a participant in improving the information. We are happy to answer questions Recognizing the inherent limitations in the documented information about OSG, and because we enjoy getting to know the other people in our grid community, we expect to get questions, and are happy to answer them (if we know the answer). And if we don't know the answer we probably have an idea about where to find the answer. But we can't answer questions unless you ask, so please ask. Remember, there are no stupid questions, only stupid answers. If your question is about a suspicious behavior, possibly an incident, then email us at security@opensciencegrid.org . This is a 24*7 alert list that we immediately respond to. How can we help you more effectively? Don't hesitate to tell us how we can be more effective or to ask a question. You can email security@opensciencegrid.org or contact one of the security team members individually. Background It is expected that the administrative and security contacts for a resource registered with OSG (in OIM) are capable of dealing with the normal system administration and security practices of running a cluster of machines for scientific computing. The security materials provided on the OSG twiki occasionally mention examples of how basic computer security features could be handled but that is not a replacement for formal in-depth training on unix system administration. Having said that we know that some small site admins (e.g. Tier-3s) may not have much experience in system level security. We have started collecting some examples in a Documentation.SecurityBestPractices page (which you are welcome to contribute to). If there are particular issues that you would like to learn more about (e.g. firewall configuration, linux updates), we can gladly point you to more specific resources. We may not have the effort to train you on basic security topics, but we will try our best to give you resources and put you in the right direction. Let us know! Site Security Responsibilities The following are the top security items that sites need to follow as members in the OSG. 1. Security contact information in OIM Site security contacts can update their contact information from the OSG Information Management (OIM) system by clicking the Profile link at the top. However, you will need a personal X.509 certificate in your web browser in order to register with OIM and for access to update your information. The OSG will do a periodic assessment of the contact information (once a year) to remind users to keep their information up-to-date. But it is expected that people will keep their own information current. Note Even if there are no changes to your contact information on your profile page you will still need to update your confirmation date. At the bottom of your profile page there is a \"Confirmation\" section. You will need to click on the \"Update Confirmation Date\", and then you MUST also click on the \"Submit\" button at the bottom in order for the new confirmation date to take affect. Note Please update OIM and notify the GOC whenever the operations or security contacts for your site changes. Note Maintaining valid contact information is 50% of being a GREAT site admin! Seriously. We will send you security patch notices, updates, instructions for risk mitigation, and so on. Without valid contact information your site will not get these important notices. Also, if you become unresponsive to all of our notification attempts, we will start thinking your site is no longer participating in the OSG. 2. Read Security Notifications from OSG OSG sends out security notifications to all security contacts when important events occur, such as a vulnerability notice requiring a software update. If you receive a notice you are expected to read it and the detailed information linked to a GOC ticket (if there is a link). Note You will need your personal certificate that is registered with OIM in your browser in order to read the details of the notice in the ticket. 3. Know your institutional cyber security officer Most institutions have someone responsible for cyber security at the institution, usually reporting to the CIO (Chief Information Officer) of the institution. The person responsible may have the title of Cyber Security Officer, or Computer Protection Program Manager, or some other title. They are typically responsible for security of the central IT systems, network security, and security awareness training for the users at that institution. You should know who that person is. If you don't know who that is, consider the following scenario: A suspicious process is found running on one of your compute elements. Doing some initial checks it appears that there may be some additional problems on the machine and a rootkit may be installed. Who is going to come help investigate? It will likely be someone from the local cyber security officer's team. They will also likely have the resources and data to determine the extent of the compromise at your site and the risks to the other machines on the network. You should introduce yourself to the cyber security officer and discuss any institutional requirements for the operation of your grid site. Remember your local security team is always the primary party responsible for the security of your site. They may want to understand what your participation in OSG means. 4. Maintain up-to-date VO and user access information Each VO on OSG keeps a up-to-date list of their members. These are the users that should be given access to sites on behalf of the VOs. It is important to keep these lists up to date so that when VO removes a user for whatever reason, your site would also stop providing access to the particular user. 5. Reporting and Responding to Security Incidents The goal of the OSG security team in incident handling is to first contain the incident to prevent it from spreading, and then to help the site administrators diagnose the cause or vulnerability of the incident. Then we can learn from the incident and improve the infrastructure accordingly. Because we are participating in a world wide infrastructure, the OSG will confidentially share information about incidents that is relevant to our partners in other countries. This means that we will keep you in the loop before we disclose any information about your site. When you first contact us, we will work with you and your local security team to decide what information we can share with other communities. We will not endanger your site's public reputation. We will share information when we believe other grid sites also subject to the same attack. Any circumstance that causes the grid credentials (X.509 certificate private key or proxy certificate) to be compromised should be reported to the OSG. What does compromised mean? It means the private key of an X.509 certificate, or a proxy certificate file, is accessible to someone or some process which is not the owner of the credential (not counting the root account). Also, if the root account is hacked on any system which stores X.509 private keys or proxy certificate files then all those credentials should be considered compromised. If you have evidence that the compromised credentials were actually used by the intruder, that should be reported as well. Note that these credentials can be either for a person or for a host or service. If it is an X.509 certificate private key that is compromised, that should also be reported to the issuing Certificate Authority so that certificate can be revoked. If any system which runs grid services, hosts grid software, or runs grid batch jobs has its root account hacked, then that incident should be reported to OSG. When an incident is confidentially reported to the OSG then someone from the OSG security team will follow-up with the site and proceed according to the circumstances. 6. Respond to requests from the OSG Security Officer In many ways, the most important security requirement for running a site is that you communicate with the OSG Security Officer and the Security Team. When issues come up or incidents occur there is usually some manual intervention required and this means reading email from the OSG security team or taking phone calls (in the most urgent cases). In order to be sure that OSG can communicate with the site administrator responsible for security of a site there is the periodic update of contact information in OIM. If you have confidential information to provide to the OSG security team, it can be sent via encrypted email or submitted as a security ticket to the GOC (requires a registered X509 certificate in your browser). Of course, you can always use the telephone as well for secure communications (call the GOC or individual security team members). Note Anything you tell OSG security team in confidentiality will be kept confidential. We will not share it with any other parties, including other sites, VOs, and OSG management. Of course, if the preservation of the information presents an imminent threat against the security of OSG, we may need to share it with other parties. BUT, before doing that we will inform you first, and decide how much to disclose and how to disclose the information. 7. Be familiar with the OSG Security web site Information regarding incident handling, security best practices, awareness training, procedures, etc. is linked from the main OSG Security twiki page. You should familiarize yourself with this information and browse through it before you have a security incident. Especially the sections marked URGENT and Security Awareness for OSG Participants. If you have any questions about any of the material ASK. 8. Communicate Securely The OSG Security team encourages the use of secure email communication. All official announcements from the OSG security team will be digitally signed. We encourage you to verify the digital signatures on OSG security announcements. Also when sending sensitive information to the OSG security team, we encourage you to encrypt your messages. More information here 8.

About This Document As a user of OSG, you are responsible for three aspects of security: Protecting your grid identity token Abiding by the policies of your Virtual Organization (VO) that authorizes access to resources Reporting known or suspected breaches of security This document covers each of these areas of responsibility. Protecting Your Grid Identity Token The grid identity token is a PKI X509 digital certificate with a lifetime of one year, and a private key to which only the user has access. Protecting your grid identity means protecting your private key so that no one else is able to use (or misuse) it. Typically the private key is stored in a file called $HOME/.globus/userkey.pem. The (public) certificate needs to be accessible to parties and resources to which you'll need to authenticate yourself. It is typically stored in a file called $HOME/.globus/usercert.pem. To protect your private key, please follow these security guidelines with respect to your userkey.pem file: Copy userkey.pem to and/or store it only in a file that is accessible to yourself alone, i.e., to which no one else has privileges. In particular, observe the following: Do not keep unnecessary copies of it. Do not copy it to or store it in AFS or other shared file system. Do not copy it to or store it in a directory that is accessible to the network. The private key must be encrypted with a suitably complex passphrase that only you know. Typical Unix permissions should be 0400, readable only by owner. You may also keep a copy of your certificate and private key in your web browser. Here, too, the private key must be encrypted using the features of your browser for encrypting keys and passwords. For Mozilla Firefox this is called the Master Password of the Software Security Device. If your private key is compromised, please revoke your certificate immediately and get a new one (see How do I get a user certificate in OSG? ). If your VO does not provide instructions on revoking your certificate, then contact the registration authority (RA) that issued the certificate, or directly contact the certificate authority (CA) that issued it. Abiding by the policies of your VO Every VO through which you access OSG resources has a science mission for which use of these resources is allowed. If you use OSG resources in a manner that is not directly or indirectly meeting the purpose of your VO, then you are in violation of the OSG acceptable use policy (AUP), and your VO can suspend your access to OSG resources. Reporting known or suspected breaches of security If you suspect or have knowledge of a security incident, please report it immediately to your local OSG grid security contact.

Policy Note This policy was approved by the OSG Security Officer (Mine Altunay) on Jun 16 2009. Approved by the OSG Executive Director (Ruth Pordes) on Jul 15 2009. The interconnected nature of OSG requires that all OSG participants share responsibility for security. The security of each OSG site and VO impacts on the security of other OSG sites and VOs, as well as on partner grids. The OSG Grid Acceptable Use Policy and Service Agreement specify requirements for OSG participants, including security requirements. Furthermore, every OSG site and VO must register a security contact in the OSG Information Management System who will be responsive to requests from the OSG Security Officer. In the event that a site or VO presents an immediate operational security threat to the grid, the OSG Security Officer may immediately remove the site or VO from the OSG operational infrastructure on a temporary basis while awaiting an Executive Board decision. In the event that a site or VO presents a significant and persistent security threat to the grid, the OSG Security Officer may recommend to the Executive Board that the site or VO be removed from the OSG operational infrastructure. The decisions to remove and to later re-instate the site or VO ultimately rest with the Executive Board. The OSG Security Officer aims to work collaboratively with sites and VOs to maintain the security of OSG. Removal of a site or VO from the OSG operational infrastructure for security reasons is an option of last resort. The OSG Security Officer may initiate removal of a site or VO if one or more of the following criteria are met: The site or VO is repeatedly unresponsive to requests from the Security Officer. The site or VO persistently fails to maintain accurate security contact information in OIM. The site or VO repeatedly violates security requirements in the OSG Grid Acceptable Use Policy or Service Agreement The site or VO has repeatedly caused security incidents to spread as a result of neglect.

This page describes the associated procedures. Maintenance of Security Contact Information The Security Officer ensures that the GOC periodically confirms that all VOs and Sites have valid security contacts registered in OIM. Each Site/VO representative must confirm that they have verified the accuracy of their contact information in OIM. This confirmation is performed at least once per year. Communication In cases of Site or VO removal, the Security Officer must communicate the decision to remove the Site/VO to those that need to know and take action, while remaining sensitive to avoiding public embarrassment of the removed Site/VO. The Security Officer will send a private (digitally signed) message to VO/Site/SC security contacts registered in OIM, with instructions to forward as appropriate to the situation, but to not publicize the information further or publicly archive it (in Google, for example). Other announcements, such as updates to the VO package, will refer to the VO/Site being removed, but will not provide sensitive details about reasons for removal. These announcements can refer to removal \"for security reasons\" and direct questions to security@opensciencegrid.org. The Security Officer and Security Team will also make every effort to communicate with the VO or Site of concern in advance of removal, in the hope of avoiding the need for removal in the first place. According to the policy, VO or Site removal occurs after repeated problems. During each problem, the Security Officer will warn the VO or Site that they will be removed if they continue to violate policy. The Security Officer will inform the Executive Team in each case when a VO or Site is warned about removal. In the case of immediate removal for operational security threats, the Security Officer will notify the Executive Team of the actions being taken. Other removal actions require explicit approval by the Executive Team. Site Removal Before removing a site: The Security Officer will repeatedly warn the site security contact(s) that removal is being considered. The Security Officer will inform the Executive Team. Unless there is an immediate operational security threat, the Security Officer will await Executive Team approval before proceeding. Removing a site The Security Officer will sent an announcement to VO/Site/SC security contacts to stop sending jobs to the suspended site (for example, by reconfiguring the VO's job submission system to exclude the offending site). Unlike other announcements to security contacts, in this case the Security Officer will request the contacts to forward the announcement to VO members and others as appropriate. The GOC will mark the site as inactive in MyOSG. Note that removing the site from OIM or RSV is not considered critical from a security perspective. Site Reinstatement If the Executive Team determines that a Site should be re-instated, the following steps will be performed: The Security Officer will send an announcement to VO/Site/SC security contacts informing them that the site is no longer considered a security threat. The GOC will mark the site as active in MyOSG. VO Removal Before removing a VO: -The Security Officer will repeatedly warn the VO security contact(s) that removal is being considered. - The Security Officer will inform the Executive Team. - Unless there is an immediate operational security threat, the Security Officer will await Executive Team approval before proceeding. Removing a VO The Security Officer will sent a signed announcement to VO/Site/SC security contacts to stop accepting jobs from the suspended VO.

The OSG Software team is the primary group responsible for vulnerability handling in software that is developed and distributed by OSG. As part of the vulnerability handling process, the OSG Security Team performs a vulnerability assessment to determine the actions to take. Process The OSG Security team is responsible for performing the vulnerability assessment and notifying the OSG stakeholders about software vulnerabilities affecting the OSG infrastructure. 1. Initial Report The software vulnerability handling process begins when a vulnerability report is acknowledged by members of the OSG Security team, the OSG Software team or the GOC staff: The members of the OSG Security team actively monitor the mailing lists and other venues for announcements and discussions of vulnerabilities that may impact the software distributed by OSG and the software used at the sites for grid computing and data management. The OSG Security team should be alerted via an email or through a GOC ticket indicating it is a security issue and the urgency to resolve. OSG members are encouraged to report all security issues, including software vulnerabilities, to security@opensciencegrid.org, goc@opensciencegrid.org. 2. Triage The OSG Software and Security teams perform triage on discovered vulnerabilities or incoming reports to determine if vulnerability handling is required according to the following priority: Priority 1 : The security of services operated by OSG directly (OSG Operations, Glidein Factories), and software developed by OSG. Priority 2 : The security of software developed elsewhere which is packaged and distributed by OSG. BEST EFFORT ONLY : Software issues that may impact large numbers of OSG's resource providers or users in a serious way, but do not fit into either of the priority groups above. If the report is valid and it matches the given priorities, the vulnerability assessment procedure must be triggered and a member of the OSG Security team should be assigned as responsible for leading the process. If the report is valid, but it does not match any of the given priorities, the OSG Security team does not trigger the vulnerability assessment procedure. However, if the reporter agrees, the OSG Software team will handle the report as a regular software issue. If the report is not valid, no further actions within the OSG Security and OSG Software teams are required. If the incoming report is made through a GOC ticket, it must be updated accordingly. Regardless the course of action decided for the report, the reporter must receive an acknowledgment from the OSG Security team through a direct email. Describing the course of action email message is left at OSG Security team discretion. 3. Analysis The OSG security team assesses the risk associated with the vulnerability in consultation with the OSG Software team, the relevant software providers and other related parties as appropriate. Based on the risk assessment, if a fix is required in the OSG Software stack, the OSG Security team should discuss with OSG Software and Release teams to set a target date. If the fix should come from the software provider, the OSG Security team should work with the software provider to determine when a fix will be available and if there are work-arounds. The OSG security team prepares a draft for an advisory, and establishes as needed a grace-period for updates and further analysis. All members of the OSG Security team are asked to review the draft and send feedback. The final revision of the advisory should be approved by the OSG Security Officer. 4. Disclosure A security announcement is sent to the VO/Site/SC security contacts. A GOC Security ticket should be created for further discussion about the vulnerability. The OSG Security team determines if a private disclosure to OSG security contacts is warranted. The OSG Security team may revise the target date for a public disclosure as needed, in consultation with involved parties. Note For issues that impact peer grids (EGI, WLCG, XSEDE), the OSG Security team makes a private disclosure to the corresponding peer grid contacts. 5. Closure The GOC Security tickets are usually closed after 2 weeks. If a grace-period has been established and the ticket must remain open, the member of the OSG Security Team leading the process should update the ticket accordingly.","title":"Software Vulnerability Handling"},{"location":"SoftwareVulnerabilityHandling/#osg-software-vulnerability-notification-handling","text":"A software vulnerability is a weakness that allows an attacker to violate the integrity of the OSG infrastructure and/or the sites for grid computing.

By defining the Security Team\u2019s expectations regarding container configuration, we ensure that all relevant teams understand the necessary requirements and precautions laid out in Section 2 below. Since the service container images developed by the OSG Software Team are often deployed at the network edge and are accessible from the Internet, it is important that we have a standardized way of building and updating these images in order to minimize the risk to these edge services. This policy defines basic security requirements for new and existing service containers, a process for updating container images in a timely manner, and the exception process. 2 Policy Statement Service container images must be based on the most up to date, OSG-supported upstream OS container images, and should be rebuilt weekly. The base OS container image must be updated with the latest security updates from the upstream providers. Service container images intended for production use should use the \u201clatest released\u201d version of the service software when possible. 2.1 Exceptions Exceptions to this policy must be documented and reviewed by the Security Team per Section 3.2 of the OSG Master Information Security Policy & Procedures document. 3 Adhering to this Policy New container images must be validated by the Software Team to ensure compliance with the requirements laid out in Section 2, with the Security Team providing guidance when necessary. Container images should also be checked for compliance with the requirements in Section 2 by automated tools prior to being pushed to public repositories and upon update. Additionally, automated tools should be used to ensure that container images do not contain any known vulnerabilities. Container images that fail automated validation should be triaged, and if necessary an exception should be requested as laid out in Section 2.1 of this policy document. An ideal automated scanning solution will ensure, with each change registered in the continuous integration system, that: All upstream packages in each base image are at the best-available security patch level. Common security-related misconfigurations and past OSG misconfigurations are not present. However, we acknowledge that it will take time to get such a system in place, and in the meantime manual review by the Software Team is considered acceptable. The Security Team recommends that any teams running OSG service containers restart their containers weekly to ensure they are running updated images. Additionally, teams running service containers should consider peristing their application logs to a seperate volume or sending them to a remote log server.","title":"OSGContainerSecurityPolicy"},{"location":"policy/OSGContainerSecurityPolicy/#osg-service-container-security-policy","text":"Version 1.0 Updated 1 Dec 2019 Authors: Mike Stanfield Information Security Officer: Josh Drake","title":"OSG Service Container Security Policy"},{"location":"policy/OSGContainerSecurityPolicy/#1-reason-for-policy","text":"This policy is intended to describe how the Open Science Grid (OSG) ensures service containers deployed by OSG and sites are built and maintained in a secure manner.

This includes publicly accessible OSG services, supporting infrastructure, and infrastructure used by OSG staff essential to the OSG mission (e.g. systems supporting OSG development and personal workstations of OSG staff with administrative access). This document does NOT cover incidents at resource provider\u2019s sites and virtual organizations (VOs). While OSG Security Team will make ourselves available to the extent possible to help with such incidents, they are outside of our scope of control and responsibility. An information security \u200b incident \u200b(henceforth an \u201cincident\u201d) is an occurrence that actually or potentially jeopardizes the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an information system or the information the system processes, stores, or transmits or that constitutes a violation or imminent threat of violation of information or security policies, security procedures, or acceptable use policies. Discovery of a vulnerability in one or more pieces of software or dependencies of the OSG services could also cause an incident. An incident may involve malicious entities, accidents, or any state that poses risk. Policies of institutions which house the staff and infrastructure comprising the OSG project and facility (i.e.University of California - San Diego, University of Wisconsin-Madison, University of Nebraska - Lincoln, Indiana University, University of Chicago) could potentially be found to be in conflict with this policy under unforeseen circumstances. In that event, staff or infrastructure are bound by the policies of their housing institution. No such conflict is known and if any such conflict is discovered, it must be brought to the attention of the OSG Information Security Officer (ISO) immediately. 2 Goals of OSG Incident Response Any process should have prioritized goals to guide tactical and time-critical decisions. For OSG incident response, the goals are, in decreasing priority: Minimize the negative impacts from an incident in terms of: a. loss of integrity of OSG services or data entrusted to those services b. negative impact to resource providers' systems as a result of their OSG participation c. negative impact cause to consumers of OSG-developed, maintained, or distributed software d. damage to OSG reputation due to actual security issues or perceived risk / lack of trust. Protect the confidentiality of non-public information entrusted to OSG systems and services. Keep OSG management and stakeholders informed. Collect information needed to understand the specific impact the incident had on OSG and prevent future incidents. Maintain the operational availability of OSG services to its user community. Collect evidence needed for identifying or prosecuting perpetrators. These priorities may be adjusted by the OSG ISO for a particular incident. For example, multiple incidents perceived to be caused by the same perpetrator may increase the priority of identifying that perpetrator and collecting evidence, as removing a persistent attacker supports higher priority objectives. 3 Roles, Responsibilities, and Authority The following list includes primary entities involved in incident response and their general responsibilities. This is intended to offer more detail specific to incident response, and does not override anything written in the MISPP. Additional, specific responsibilities are addressed in Sections 5 and 6. OSG Incident Response Team (\u201cIR Team\u201d) An incident-specific, ad-hoc team formed to handle an incident. Will often include members of Security, Software, Operations and Release teams, but actual composition will vary depending on the nature of each incident. OSG Incident Response Lead Designated Security team member assigned by ISO. Responsibilities: Set incident classification. Sends reports of incident progress to the ISO regularly Ensure the relevant policies and procedures in this document and elsewhere are followed Assemble and direct IR team Ensure that a complete and correct record of the incident is maintained Ensure that a complete and correct IR report is written Authorities: Act in place of the ISO making cybersecurity risk decisions during an incident if needed when the ISO (For statements such as this, there is an implied \u201cand backups\u201d for the role under discussion, hence the chain of authority is ISO, backup ISO, IR Lead) is unavailable. Authorize the suspension or removal of any OSG resource, user, service, job, VO, etc. until the incident has been resolved and related issues remediated. Determine what remediations are appropriate to resolve an incident, and oversee the process of incident response. Enlist OSG staff to assist with incident response or join the Incident Responseteam, ideally in coordination with their management. OSG Service Owners Refer to the \u200b OSG Service Catalog\u200b for Point of Contact for various OSG services. Responsibilities: Leads interactions with their campus security and IT staff(The OSG Service Owner owns this responsibility since they are physically located at a different institution where the ISO is not). Assists the IR team as needed in responding to an incident, for example by retrieving logs from affected systems, or making prescribed changes to remediate vulnerabilities. Authorities: Disconnect the OSG service from the network, ideally in consultation with the OSG ISO and OSG Management. Suspend OSG users and similar entities. Resource Provider administrator, VO administrator or security point of contact: Responsibilities: Work with relevant site\u2019s local security team during an incident, as appropriate. Inform the OSG Security team of any incident locally which may impact OSG or the site\u2019s participation in OSG. Coordinate with the OSG IR team in the case of any incident that impacts multiple sites, services, or other parties across OSG. Remove the resource center or VO from OSG if it may be harming OSG or OSG users/resources as a result of an ongoing security incident. Authorities: Request to the OSG ISO or IR Lead to approve the reconnection of the resource center or VO to OSG after issues related to a security incident have been remediated. OSG ISO (Josh Drake, IU): Backups, in order of preference: Zalak Shah, IU Adrian Crenshaw, IU Any other active member of OSG Security Team Responsibilities: Ensures regular communication with OSG Management and stakeholders as needed during an incident. Ensures appropriate communication with OSG users regarding incidents. Ensures appropriate communication with other institutions\u2019 Security Offices if needed. Authorities: Declares a security incident, when deemed necessary, and names an Incident Response Lead for that incident. OSG Security Team (Shah, Drake, Crenshaw, Kiser (IU)): Responsibilities: Help as requested by the IR Lead during an incident. Perform post-mortem analysis of incident in conjunction with the IR team and other relevant parties. Maintain readiness for incidents. Own the follow-through on issues discovered during incidents and security exercises. 4 Incident Response Stages The OSG\u2019s incident response strategy is described in this section based on the anticipated stages of an incident. 4.1 Preparation The OSG Security team, service owners, Operations and Software teams will maintain the following on an ongoing basis to be prepared for any incident: The Security and other OSG teams will have appropriate information to allow for secure communications during an incident (e.g. phone numbers, GPG keys). The security team will work with server owners to establish centralized (per site) system logging and an appropriate level of network logging, to allow for analysis and with a retention window of at least 90 days, as resources become available for these changes. An infrastructure map detailing all OSG computers and logical network layout will be maintained and updated at least every 30 days. A list of IP addresses and their associated network hosts will be maintained and updated at least every 30 days. The OSG Security team, with the help of the service owners, will maintain an up-to-date inventory of all the software packages and dependencies for each individual OSG service. The OSG Security team will monitor notifications/announcements regarding the vulnerabilities and security patches on a regular basis and will check whether any of the vulnerabilities could potentially affect the OSG service(s) or the users based on an existing inventory. The OSG Security team\u2019s web page under GitHub will have directions for OSG users and other outside parties about how they can report a security incident to the OSG. To contact the OSG Security team regarding a suspected incident please email security@opensciencegrid.org\u200b - you may encrypt your email for privacy using GPG (Key id#7FD42669, fingerprint 6E5F 4DD8 7ABC 9F68 A49B F3CA 15E3 B3AD 7FD4 2669). The Security team will regularly audit the above items to ensure they are in place and lead a monthly security exercise to ensure preparedness and increase the maturity of operational security at OSG. 4.2 Incident Initialization Potential or known incidents may be reported by the OSG staff, OSG users, or third parties such as incident reporting or coordination organizations. Notification from the OSG staff, and reports from OSG users and third parties should go directly to the OSG Security team. ACTION by OSG team Member who first becomes aware of the potential incident\u200b: The team member should: 1. Attempt to contact the ISO. 2. Failing that, attempt to contact a Backup ISO from the list in section 3 of this document. The Backup ISO, when contacted, will act in place of the ISO for the purpose of incident-related authority and responsibilities named in section 3 above. 3. If no ISO or backup ISO is reachable (rare) contact any member of the OSG Executive Team for further instructions. ACTION by ISO\u200b: The ISO will make the determination of whether an occurrence is an incident. ACTION by ISO\u200b: If determined to be an incident, the ISO will assign it an identifier based on a template of year-month-day_sequencialnumber, e.g. \u201c2019-03-18_001\u201d(For an exercise, append \u201c_EXERCISE\u201d to the name, e.g. \u201c2019-03-18_001_EXERCISE\u201d). ACTION by ISO\u200b: When an occurrence is identified as an incident, the ISO will set an initial priority of either high or normal: High priority means that the OSG Security team members are expected to handle any request related to the incident in preference to all other work. Normal priority\u200b means that the OSG Security team members are expected to prioritize incident handling using their judgement. Setting priorities is a subjective process, with the level of certainty the incident represents a compromise of the OSG and the impact of the compromise playing significant roles. Prioritization is expected to track classification as defined in Section 5 but will be set before classification has been determined. 4.3 Formation of Incident Response Team ACTION by ISO\u200b: The ISO will designate and contact an Incident Response Lead. ACTION by IR Lead:\u200b The IR Lead will determine what personnel are needed on the IR team and contact those individuals. ACTION by IR Lead\u200b: The Incident Response lead should communicate the initiation of an incident by sending an email to \u200bstaff@opensciencegrid.org\u200b with the priority and make up of the Incident Response team in the body. As with any email about the incident, the incident identifier will be used in the subject of any email message. Do not describe the exact nature of an incident here, as this email traffic is widely distributed in the clear. ACTION by IR Lead\u200b: The IR Lead will create a JIRA issue in the Security project to store data regarding the incident . Set the Security Level to \u201cSecurity team\u201d so that the issue will only be viewable by the OSG Security team. 4.4 Analysis and Containment Guided by the Goals of OSG Incident Response, the Incident Response team will initially work to contain the incident, minimizing its impact to the OSG, and determine its nature. During this phase, changes should be minimized to what is necessary to prevent further damage in order to preserve evidence. ACTION by the IR Lead, IR Team\u200b: The Incident Response team will conduct the investigation, with other OSG staff assisting as needed. During this phase, the IR Lead may change the prioritization of the incident or the membership of the Incident Response team based on an evolving understanding of the incident. During this phase, it is important not to modify or alter any logs or configuration unless it is urgent and critical to maintaining the confidentiality or integrity of other data. This is to maintain useful forensics. If alteration is necessary, careful notes (or screenshots, etc.) must be taken so that the original state prior to the change can be reconstructed. Notice of the alteration must be communicated to the Security team and IR Lead immediately. ACTION by IR Lead\u200b: The IR Lead will keep the ISO informed of any major developments and discoveries, making at least twice a day updates. ACTION by IR Lead\u200b: The IR Lead will keep OSG User Support (\u200bsupport@osg-htc.org\u200b) informed of any user-visible service impacts of the incident. The incident identifier will be used in the subject of any email message related to the incident. 4.5 Eradication and Recovery During this phase, the Security team will make a recommendation (suggesting, for example, a code or configuration change) to the Software team and or Service owner on how to manage the vulnerability, based on the relevant vulnerability report or an analysis of flaws in OSG-maintained code. This recommendation, especially when addressing flaws in OSG code, should be made in careful consultation with the relevant service or software owner. ACTION by IR Lead\u200b: The IR Lead will continue to keep the ISO informed of any major developments, making at least twice a day updates. ACTION by IR Lead\u200b: The IR lead will continue to keep OSG User Support informed of any user-visible service impacts of the incident. ACTION by IR Team\u200b: If necessary, a member of the IR team in consultation with the other IR team members will send an update to the user community about when they should expect a security release and what they can do to mitigate the issue in the meantime. The incident identifier will be used in the subject of any email message related to the incident. 4.6 Incident Closure and Documentation ACTION by IR Lead\u200b: After consulting with the ISO, the IR Lead will mark the JIRA issue for the incident as Resolved and communicate the incident conclusion by sending an email to staff@opensciencegrid.org\u200b. ACTION by IR Lead\u200b: The IR Lead will document the incident, including its classification as described in Section 5. The documentation should use the OSG IR Template. 4.7 Post-Mortem and Remedial Action ACTION by ISO\u200b: The ISO will note any suspended accounts, projects, etc. from the incident report and determine a long-term disposition for those. ACTION by ISO\u200b: The ISO or delegate will lead a post-mortem that consists of determining what remedial action should be taken to minimize the chance of the incident repeating and work with OSG Management to implement such remediation. 5 Incident Handling Procedures 5.1 Incident Classification OSG incidents are classified based on their perceived impact. Classification may not be known at the start of an incident due to lack of information and may change as understanding of the incident improves. This classification guides responses as described elsewhere in this document. These classifications are based on those in [NIST 800-61] Section 3.2.6. N.B. Normally, an incident classified as \u201cHigh\u201d here is high priority per section 4.2 above, and all others are considered medium priority. However, some incidents may be up-classed to high at the discretion of the IR Lead if they present a contagious or potentially contagious problem: e.g. an APT targeting multiple OSG, HTC, or HEP targets, self-propagating malware, or a moderate impact software vulnerability in a near-ubiquitous dependency that will be difficult to remediate or work around due to its pervasiveness. Incident classifications are: High - An incident is considered High if it involves: Compromise of confidentiality or integrity of PII(It is the belief of the Security team that the OSG does not hold Sensitive PII as of the date of publication of this document.). Compromise of confidentiality or integrity of a password database. Compromise of confidentiality or integrity of software vulnerability information. Attention by media outlets or other public dissemination (e.g. via an Internet social media site). Major disruption to the OSG\u2019s ability to provide service to the user community. A successful compromise is believed to have been ongoing for more than a week. An incident is believed to have possible financial consequences. An incident is believed to involve an insider threat. A high-severity vulnerability, including: vulnerabilities that allow an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code or escalate privileges. vulnerabilities that allow an attacker to access or exfiltrate data that is not theirs from the core system Medium - An incident is considered Medium if it involves: Disruption to the OSG\u2019s ability to provide service to multiple users for an extended time (more than 10 minutes). Compromise of multiple users\u2019 accounts by the same party. Any compromise that appears to specifically target OSG personnel. A medium-severity vulnerability- allows a local user to gain privileges. allows an authenticated remote user to execute arbitrary code somewhere other than their host belonging to their jobs. that lowers the difficulty of denial of service attempts. Low - An incident is considered Low if it involves: Disruption to a single user\u2019s ability to use the OSG (e.g. a compromised password that results in temporarily disabling their account). A short-term (less than 10 minutes) disruption in OSG\u2019s availability due to a denial of service attack. A long-term disruption to non-critical services or degradation of critical services. Attempted but unsuccessful attempt to compromise the OSG service in some way that appears to target the OSG specifically and is not normal untargeted Internet \u201cbackground noise.\u201d A low-severity vulnerability- one that has a cosmetic-only or has an inconvenience impact rather than a compromise of confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Vulnerabilities that have high or medium impact but are especially difficult to exploit. Undetermined - Impact of the incident is unknown. Prioritization will be determined by classification level set by the ISO and IR Lead based on the available data. 5.2 Secure Communication During Incidents During an incident investigation, members of the IR team may need to share sensitive information and discuss suspected vulnerabilities in the OSG. The following methods of communication of sensitive data are approved: OSG JIRA, using the Security Project S/MIME encrypted and signed email GPG-encrypted and signed email It has been noted that GPG signatures are fragile and often do not validate for benign reasons. Staff should also validate a request using an alternate channel if they have any doubt as to the legitimacy of a message. It has been noted that emails are not predictable in their delivery latency and cannot be relied on for timely communication. Phone (voice & secure message app Signal) In person IU Slashtmp - CRITICAL version Transfers must be initiated by IU account holder When communication of sensitive data using an approved method is not possible (e.g. not all management is familiar with the above methods), OSG personnel must exercise judgment regarding the method, content, and timing of related communications. Integrity of communications is also important, particularly when instructions are sent or requests for sensitive data are made. Secure communications should be used for such circumstances. 5.3 Incident Handling After Normal Working Hours OSG staff are not expected to work outside of normal working hours unless special arrangements have been made by the OSG management. Given that the integrity of OSG data(For example, source code and configuration data for OSG services) is more important than its availability, a reasonable response to an incident outside of normal working hours is to take the affected OSG service offline until the next business day. Taking the OSG service offline is done by contacting the Service owner. 5.4 Communication with User Support OSG User Support is one of the interfaces to our user community. They might see reports from our users before the rest of the team and respond to those reports. Hence, it is valuable to keep them informed during an incident of factors that may impact our users so that: (1) they can best communicate to users who may contact them and (2) alert the IR team if a user reports something that we are not aware of. User Support will forward the advisory or recommendation along with the security patches (if available) for known vulnerabilities to our user community. The IR Lead and/or ISO should keep them informed via email to \u200bsupport@osg-htc.org during the incident. 6 Interactions with Other Entities 6.1 Law Enforcement When and if an incident should be reported to law enforcement will be decided by the OSG ISO in consultation with OSG Management. All communications with Law Enforcement will be handled by the ISO and Executive Director, or at their direction. 6.2 Media and General Public All media communication will be handled by the OSG Executive Director or their designee. Any OSG staff contacted by the media should refer them to the Executive Director unless authorized by the Executive Director to communicate with the media. 6.3 Incident Reporting/Coordination Organizations The OSG ISO may decide to report any incident to incident reporting or coordination organizations (e.g. US CERT, REN-ISAC, EGI, WLCG). OSG staff should not do so without consultation with the OSG ISO. 6.4 Other institutions hosting OSG Services The OSG Security team will communicate with other institutions hosting OSG services such as UW-Madison, University of Chicago, UCSD and UNL staff as needed during the incident. 6.5 OSG Users OSG users should be kept informed as determined by the IR Lead. OSG users are also encouraged to keep their Security and Admin contacts up to date. 6.6 Other Outside Parties Other parties include owners of attacking addresses, other affected parties, software vendors, and other incident response teams. See section 2.3.4.4 of [NIST 800-61] for a discussion of these interactions. The IR Lead coordinates all such interactions. 7 Abbreviations and Acronyms APT: Advanced Persistent Threat, i.e. a skilled attacker persistently targeting something specific HEP: High-Energy Physics HTC: High-Throughput Computing ISO: Information Security Officer IDS: Intrusion Detection System IT: Information Technology OSG: Open Science Grid PII: Personally Identifiable Information UW: University of Wisconsin, Madison 8 Reference Documents [NIST 800-61] NIST Computer Security Incident Handling Guide. http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-61rev2/SP800-61rev2.pdf [CERT 2006] Action List for Developing a Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT). http://www.cert.org/incident-management/csirt-development/action-list.cfm 9 Appendix: Procedure for Vulnerability Management A vulnerability is a coding flaw, glitch or weakness that impacts OSG and/or OSG Services. Preparation:\u200b The Security team monitors relevant vulnerability reports, announcements, and discussions on a regular basis. The Security team maintains an inventory of all the software, tools, and dependencies that have been installed on various OSG services. The Security team also keeps a contact list of important stakeholders ready and updated. We have published our PGP public key on OSG\u2019s website to enable outside parties to easily reach out with vulnerability reports. OSG users are encouraged to report all the security issues, including software vulnerabilities, to the Security team at \u200b security@opensciencegrid.org\u200b . Initial Report:\u200b Whenever the Security team receives a new vulnerability report, announcement, or an alert from OSG users, the Security team compares the name of the software/package to the inventory to check if we are running the affected software/package at the affected version. Upon examination, the Security team creates a private JIRA ticket indicating it is an incident with the sec-low/sec-med/sec-high/sec-critical label. The Security team uses the same JIRA ticket for all the internal discussions regarding the vulnerability to maintain confidentiality. If the vulnerability was reported by a third party, the Security team will coordinate the tentative timeline with the reporter and will keep them updated if anything changes. The Security team will also ask them not to disclose the reported vulnerability and/or an exploit until we publish the fix for the vulnerability, and will discuss if and how the reporter would like their work to be credited. Triage:\u200b The Security team will triage the vulnerability reports to determine whether the reported vulnerability is within scope for our action, by asking the following questions: 1. Does the reported vulnerability impact the security of OSG services, or currently-supported software developed/maintained by OSG? 2. Does the reported vulnerability impact the security of software distributed by OSG? 3. Does the reported vulnerability fail the first two tests above, but negatively impact the security of the OSG community in a significant way? If the answer to either of the first two questions is \u2018yes\u2019 the security team will begin responding to the vulnerability. If the answer to the third question is \u2018yes\u2019, the security team may, but is not required to, make a best-effort attempt to notify the community about the implications of the issue. All other vulnerabilities are out of scope. ACTION by the Security team: \u200b A member of the Security team will triage the vulnerability reports to determine their relevance and impact. Analysis: \u200bFor vulnerabilities deemed within scope, the Security team will assess the risk associated with the vulnerability in consultation with other OSG teams, software provider, and other appropriate parties. Based on the assessment, risk will be addressed in one of the three ways, i.e. remediate, mitigate, or accept. Remediate: Apply a patch and resolve the vulnerability Vulnerability? -> develop a patch -> apply that patch -> TEST -> release a new version -> ask users to update to the new version The Security team also analyzes whether a reported vulnerability is worthy of a security release. The Security team makes that decision based on the severity, for example described in the report of Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The Security team and other involved parties will work on a patch/fix in a private manner. They will use a private ticketing system (JIRA) and include only a small group of developers to work on a private (non-published) git branch Software Team (or other software owner) retains control of the software and handles the remediation process with support from the Security Team. It is important that software is never\u200b left in a state unfamiliar to its owners, e.g. by security team taking over and implementing a fix on their own. Git commit messages do not include any vulnerability related information, they use something like \u201caddress issues outlined in ticket XXXX\u201d Mitigate: Find an alternative/temporary solution to minimize the impact or the likelihood Accept: Accept the risk without remediation or mitigation The Security team also prepares an advisory for the OSG users. Disclosure:\u200b The Security team will coordinate a public release date with the downstream providers and important stakeholders. They will also make sure that critical infrastructure partners update their systems on the same day. On a public release date, the Software team will merge the private (non-published) branch and will not provide any details about the exploit. The Security team will provide enough details about the vulnerability so that the OSG users could assess their risk and exposure but will not disclose any details on how to exploit the vulnerability. The Security team will restrict the JIRA ticket details for at least 30 days after a public release date and then make that ticket and the whole of the vulnerability details public. The Security team may revise the public release date as needed, in consultation with the involved parties. After having all the necessary information about the vulnerability, the Security team will prepare a security announcement. All the communications to and from the reporter and the communications with the OSG users will be done in a private manner.","title":"OSGIncidentResponsePolicy"},{"location":"policy/OSGIncidentResponsePolicy/#osg-incident-response-policies-and-procedures","text":"Version 1.0 Updated 1 Dec 2019 Authors: Zalak Shah Information Security Officer: Josh Drake","title":"*OSG Incident Response Policies and Procedures"},{"location":"policy/OSGIncidentResponsePolicy/#1-introduction-and-scope","text":"This document covers policies and procedures for handling computer security incidents impacting infrastructure owned and operated by the OSG project, or software developed, maintained, or distributed by OSG.

For OSG incident response, the goals are, in decreasing priority: Minimize the negative impacts from an incident in terms of: a. loss of integrity of OSG services or data entrusted to those services b. negative impact to resource providers' systems as a result of their OSG participation c. negative impact cause to consumers of OSG-developed, maintained, or distributed software d. damage to OSG reputation due to actual security issues or perceived risk / lack of trust. Protect the confidentiality of non-public information entrusted to OSG systems and services. Keep OSG management and stakeholders informed. Collect information needed to understand the specific impact the incident had on OSG and prevent future incidents. Maintain the operational availability of OSG services to its user community. Collect evidence needed for identifying or prosecuting perpetrators. These priorities may be adjusted by the OSG ISO for a particular incident. For example, multiple incidents perceived to be caused by the same perpetrator may increase the priority of identifying that perpetrator and collecting evidence, as removing a persistent attacker supports higher priority objectives.","title":"2 Goals of OSG Incident Response"},{"location":"policy/OSGIncidentResponsePolicy/#3-roles-responsibilities-and-authority","text":"The following list includes primary entities involved in incident response and their general responsibilities. This is intended to offer more detail specific to incident response, and does not override anything written in the MISPP. Additional, specific responsibilities are addressed in Sections 5 and 6. OSG Incident Response Team (\u201cIR Team\u201d) An incident-specific, ad-hoc team formed to handle an incident. Will often include members of Security, Software, Operations and Release teams, but actual composition will vary depending on the nature of each incident. OSG Incident Response Lead Designated Security team member assigned by ISO. Responsibilities: Set incident classification. Sends reports of incident progress to the ISO regularly Ensure the relevant policies and procedures in this document and elsewhere are followed Assemble and direct IR team Ensure that a complete and correct record of the incident is maintained Ensure that a complete and correct IR report is written Authorities: Act in place of the ISO making cybersecurity risk decisions during an incident if needed when the ISO (For statements such as this, there is an implied \u201cand backups\u201d for the role under discussion, hence the chain of authority is ISO, backup ISO, IR Lead) is unavailable. Authorize the suspension or removal of any OSG resource, user, service, job, VO, etc. until the incident has been resolved and related issues remediated. Determine what remediations are appropriate to resolve an incident, and oversee the process of incident response. Enlist OSG staff to assist with incident response or join the Incident Responseteam, ideally in coordination with their management. OSG Service Owners Refer to the \u200b OSG Service Catalog\u200b for Point of Contact for various OSG services. Responsibilities: Leads interactions with their campus security and IT staff(The OSG Service Owner owns this responsibility since they are physically located at a different institution where the ISO is not). Assists the IR team as needed in responding to an incident, for example by retrieving logs from affected systems, or making prescribed changes to remediate vulnerabilities. Authorities: Disconnect the OSG service from the network, ideally in consultation with the OSG ISO and OSG Management. Suspend OSG users and similar entities. Resource Provider administrator, VO administrator or security point of contact: Responsibilities: Work with relevant site\u2019s local security team during an incident, as appropriate. Inform the OSG Security team of any incident locally which may impact OSG or the site\u2019s participation in OSG. Coordinate with the OSG IR team in the case of any incident that impacts multiple sites, services, or other parties across OSG. Remove the resource center or VO from OSG if it may be harming OSG or OSG users/resources as a result of an ongoing security incident. Authorities: Request to the OSG ISO or IR Lead to approve the reconnection of the resource center or VO to OSG after issues related to a security incident have been remediated. OSG ISO (Josh Drake, IU): Backups, in order of preference: Zalak Shah, IU Adrian Crenshaw, IU Any other active member of OSG Security Team Responsibilities: Ensures regular communication with OSG Management and stakeholders as needed during an incident.

Preparation:\u200b The Security team monitors relevant vulnerability reports, announcements, and discussions on a regular basis. The Security team maintains an inventory of all the software, tools, and dependencies that have been installed on various OSG services. The Security team also keeps a contact list of important stakeholders ready and updated. We have published our PGP public key on OSG\u2019s website to enable outside parties to easily reach out with vulnerability reports. OSG users are encouraged to report all the security issues, including software vulnerabilities, to the Security team at \u200b security@opensciencegrid.org\u200b . Initial Report:\u200b Whenever the Security team receives a new vulnerability report, announcement, or an alert from OSG users, the Security team compares the name of the software/package to the inventory to check if we are running the affected software/package at the affected version. Upon examination, the Security team creates a private JIRA ticket indicating it is an incident with the sec-low/sec-med/sec-high/sec-critical label. The Security team uses the same JIRA ticket for all the internal discussions regarding the vulnerability to maintain confidentiality. If the vulnerability was reported by a third party, the Security team will coordinate the tentative timeline with the reporter and will keep them updated if anything changes. The Security team will also ask them not to disclose the reported vulnerability and/or an exploit until we publish the fix for the vulnerability, and will discuss if and how the reporter would like their work to be credited. Triage:\u200b The Security team will triage the vulnerability reports to determine whether the reported vulnerability is within scope for our action, by asking the following questions: 1. Does the reported vulnerability impact the security of OSG services, or currently-supported software developed/maintained by OSG? 2. Does the reported vulnerability impact the security of software distributed by OSG? 3. Does the reported vulnerability fail the first two tests above, but negatively impact the security of the OSG community in a significant way? If the answer to either of the first two questions is \u2018yes\u2019 the security team will begin responding to the vulnerability. If the answer to the third question is \u2018yes\u2019, the security team may, but is not required to, make a best-effort attempt to notify the community about the implications of the issue. All other vulnerabilities are out of scope. ACTION by the Security team: \u200b A member of the Security team will triage the vulnerability reports to determine their relevance and impact. Analysis: \u200bFor vulnerabilities deemed within scope, the Security team will assess the risk associated with the vulnerability in consultation with other OSG teams, software provider, and other appropriate parties. Based on the assessment, risk will be addressed in one of the three ways, i.e. remediate, mitigate, or accept. Remediate: Apply a patch and resolve the vulnerability Vulnerability? -> develop a patch -> apply that patch -> TEST -> release a new version -> ask users to update to the new version The Security team also analyzes whether a reported vulnerability is worthy of a security release. The Security team makes that decision based on the severity, for example described in the report of Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The Security team and other involved parties will work on a patch/fix in a private manner. They will use a private ticketing system (JIRA) and include only a small group of developers to work on a private (non-published) git branch Software Team (or other software owner) retains control of the software and handles the remediation process with support from the Security Team. It is important that software is never\u200b left in a state unfamiliar to its owners, e.g. by security team taking over and implementing a fix on their own. Git commit messages do not include any vulnerability related information, they use something like \u201caddress issues outlined in ticket XXXX\u201d Mitigate: Find an alternative/temporary solution to minimize the impact or the likelihood Accept: Accept the risk without remediation or mitigation The Security team also prepares an advisory for the OSG users. Disclosure:\u200b The Security team will coordinate a public release date with the downstream providers and important stakeholders. They will also make sure that critical infrastructure partners update their systems on the same day. On a public release date, the Software team will merge the private (non-published) branch and will not provide any details about the exploit. The Security team will provide enough details about the vulnerability so that the OSG users could assess their risk and exposure but will not disclose any details on how to exploit the vulnerability. The Security team will restrict the JIRA ticket details for at least 30 days after a public release date and then make that ticket and the whole of the vulnerability details public. The Security team may revise the public release date as needed, in consultation with the involved parties. After having all the necessary information about the vulnerability, the Security team will prepare a security announcement. All the communications to and from the reporter and the communications with the OSG users will be done in a private manner.","title":"9 Appendix: Procedure for Vulnerability Management"},{"location":"policy/OSGMasterInformationSecurityPolicy/","text":"Open Science Grid Master Information Security Policy and Procedures Version 1.1 Updated 28 June 2021 Authors: Zalak Shah, Mike Stanfield Information Security Officer: Josh Drake 1 Introduction This document represents the core information security policies and procedures for Open Science Grid (OSG), including information security-related roles and responsibilities; references to other, special purpose policies; and the core procedures for developing, implementing, and maintaining an information security program. Our information security program is a structured approach to develop, implement, and maintain an organizational environment conducive to appropriate information security and levels of information-related risk. This program entails ongoing activities to address relevant policies and procedures; technology and mitigations; and training and awareness. This document is intended for the OSG Security team and OSG stakeholders. 2 Roles & Responsibilities 2.1 Management/Leadership The OSG Executive Director accepts risk on behalf of the organization, with advice from the Information Security Officer. The Executive Director will work directly with the ISO to ensure that s/he stays abreast of major security issues facing OSG, as well as the organization\u2019s security posture. Any new or changed security policies must be accepted by the Executive Director before they are put into effect. The OSG Executive Director at the time of this policy\u2019s execution is Frank Wuerthwein. The current Executive Director and Executive Team can always be found at https://opensciencegrid.org/management/#executive-team\u200b . 2.2 Information Security Officer (ISO) OSG maintains a position of Information Security Officer (ISO), who reports to the OSG Technical Director, Miron Livny, and the OSG Executive Director. The ISO has responsibility for overseeing and coordinating the information security program. The ISO maintains all security policy and procedure documents for OSG, including this document. All reviews of OSG-wide security policies and procedures are coordinated and archived through this office. The ISO\u2019s office also documents any exceptions made to security policies. The ISO is the first point of contact for any request for clarification of OSG information security policy and procedures. The ISO will coordinate information security incident response, including correspondence between the affected staff and users. As of the date of publication of this document, the Information Security Officer is\u200b \u200bJosh Drake. Contact information for the ISO follows: ISO: Josh Drake Email: drakejc@iu.edu Office Phone: 812-855-9567 OSG Security Team: security@opensciencegrid.org 2.3 Project Personnel and Staff It is the responsibility of each individual working for OSG to review and respect these policies and procedures. It is also the staff member\u2019s responsibility to understand the underlying policies that drive those detailed procedures, so that the individual is able to make rational decisions in situations not specifically covered by the detailed procedures. Each staff member is expected to immediately report any known or suspected violations of security procedures, or known or suspected information security incidents to the security team. In all cases, the staff member and the time of the incident will be documented in order to support a timely analysis of and coordinated response to the situation. 2.4 External Users External users are responsible for reviewing and respecting the following policies while using OSG resources: Open Science Grid Acceptable Use Policy Open Science Grid Privacy Policy Policy on OSG use by Commercial Entities # 3 Developing, Implementing, and Maintaining Our Cybersecurity Program The goal of the OSG is to advance open science through distributed high throughput computing. Our Cybersecurity program is an essential component in support of this goal. Both the information security risk management processes, and possible exceptions to these processes are evaluated by the management, ISO, staff, and external stakeholders with an eye towards this overarching goal. ### 3.1 Information Security Risk Management Processes The Security team is responsible for identifying, assessing and managing risks to the Open Science Grid project, as well as providing guidance and training to other teams within OSG in order to enable OSG\u2019s continued security. Goals The first goal of OSG Security is always the integrity and trustworthiness of OSG-run services and OSG-distributed software. Second to that is the confidentiality of information entrusted to OSG. Third is our availability: we will explicitly sacrifice uptime in an incident by taking down an affected system temporarily, if doing so mitigates risk to the integrity of software and services, confidentiality of data. Software vulnerabilities handled by the OSG security team will be handled with the following priorities: Top priority: OSG-developed or OSG-maintained software Second priority: OSG-distributed software which is not developed or maintained at OSG Best effort only: We may issue advisories about other software on a best-effort basis only, when it is obvious that the community would benefit from such action. Process The OSG Security Team will endeavor to raise the maturity of OSG\u2019s security program over time, through acquiring appropriate resources, helping teams get baseline best practices in place, providing security expertise to other OSG teams, and managing security incidents. The security team will also reach out to VO and resource provider security contacts to enable them to learn best practices for security with regard to their relationship with OSG. The security policies of OSG will be reviewed by the security team at least once every two years and updated as necessary. 3.2 Exception Management In order to request an exception to a particular policy, send an email to security@opensciencegrid.org\u200b with the following details. Name, version, and URL of the policy to which you want to make an exception Name of the requester Scope of the request, i.e. what would be done differently than specified in policy, for how long, and in which code or system(s). Please be as specific as possible about the implications of the request: the more research we must do, the slower our response time will be. Justification for the request, i.e. why it is a necessary exception The Security team is responsible for evaluating exceptions and the ISO (or delegate) will approve (or disapprove) most exceptions.

Our Cybersecurity program is an essential component in support of this goal. Both the information security risk management processes, and possible exceptions to these processes are evaluated by the management, ISO, staff, and external stakeholders with an eye towards this overarching goal. ### 3.1 Information Security Risk Management Processes The Security team is responsible for identifying, assessing and managing risks to the Open Science Grid project, as well as providing guidance and training to other teams within OSG in order to enable OSG\u2019s continued security. Goals The first goal of OSG Security is always the integrity and trustworthiness of OSG-run services and OSG-distributed software. Second to that is the confidentiality of information entrusted to OSG. Third is our availability: we will explicitly sacrifice uptime in an incident by taking down an affected system temporarily, if doing so mitigates risk to the integrity of software and services, confidentiality of data. Software vulnerabilities handled by the OSG security team will be handled with the following priorities: Top priority: OSG-developed or OSG-maintained software Second priority: OSG-distributed software which is not developed or maintained at OSG Best effort only: We may issue advisories about other software on a best-effort basis only, when it is obvious that the community would benefit from such action. Process The OSG Security Team will endeavor to raise the maturity of OSG\u2019s security program over time, through acquiring appropriate resources, helping teams get baseline best practices in place, providing security expertise to other OSG teams, and managing security incidents. The security team will also reach out to VO and resource provider security contacts to enable them to learn best practices for security with regard to their relationship with OSG. The security policies of OSG will be reviewed by the security team at least once every two years and updated as necessary.","title":"2.4 External Users"},{"location":"policy/OSGMasterInformationSecurityPolicy/#32-exception-management","text":"In order to request an exception to a particular policy, send an email to security@opensciencegrid.org\u200b with the following details.

Chipmakers Intel, AMD and ARM have reported that their chips are affected at varying degrees by these bugs [1]. Two attacks, Meltdown [2] and Spectre [3] have been published and are being discussed extensively. The Meltdown exploit has been successfully tested on Intel processors and it is not clear yet whether ARM and AMD processors are also affected. The Spectre attack method can theoretically be performed on any CPU family; working exploits have been demonstrated on at least Intel, AMD, and ARM processor families. These attacks have been particularly newsworthy as (a) the vulnerability is in a diverse cross-section of hardware, not software and (b) non-trivial performance impact of the mitigation techniques. However, the severity is comparable to more mundane local privilege exploits against the kernel. IMPACTED VERSIONS: These vulnerabilities are present in the hardware and appear to affect all operating systems, including Linux. Available exploits can be performed by an unprivileged process or container against the host kernel and virtual machine against the hypervisor. To exploit the vulnerabilities, an attacker needs the ability to execute arbitrary unprivileged code. This privilege is commonly available to authorized users on OSG submit hosts, Computing Elements (CEs), or worker nodes. No remote exploit is currently known. WHAT ARE THE VULNERABILITIES: The vulnerabilities are design flaws in the way many modern microprocessor designs have implemented speculative execution of instructions (a commonly used performance optimization) [4]. The Spectre attack targets the vulnerabilities described in CVE-2017-5715 [5], CVE-2017-5753 [6] and the Meltdown attack, the one described in CVE-2017-5754 [7]. WHAT YOU SHOULD DO: These vulnerabilities are present in the hardware and cannot be entirely fixed by a software update of any operating system. Mitigations exist that significantly limit the impact and increase the complexity of potential exploits. The Meltdown vulnerability can be mitigated by available software patches; however, these patches incur a higher performance penalty than most security fixes. RedHat has provided guidance [8] that HPC-style workflows should expect a 2-5% decrease in throughput; precise impact will depend on the host\u2019s workload. RedHat and Scientific Linux have mitigations available for kernel and microcode_ctl in RHEL6, RHEL7, SL6 and SL7. Additionally, there are updates for linux-firmware in RHEL7 and SL7. Please, apply these security updates IMMEDIATELY , especially on systems that are accessible by many unprivileged users. While some sites may find the performance decreases painful, OSG Security currently believes the benefits outweigh the costs. OSG Security advises sites to patch all hosts, prioritizing CEs, submit hosts, and worker nodes.

The OSG Security Team would like to inform sites of how they can reduce risk of unknown exploits by disabling unused features. The default configuration of Singularity allows image types that carry a higher theoretical risk of attack. These image types are not currently used on the OSG, no specific exploit has been found, and we believe that any discovered vulnerability would be patched by RedHat. For those reasons, sites may choose whether or not to protect against the potential vulnerability. This issue has been documented in the OSG singularity install documentation for a few months so you may already be aware of it, but there has been no OSG security announcement about it before now. IMPACTED VERSIONS: RedHat 6 & 7 and its derivatives are affected, and all versions of Singularity. WHAT IS THE POTENTIAL VULNERABILITY: By default the setuid (RPM) distribution of Singularity allows unprivileged users to mount image files via loopback devices. This carries an inherently higher exposure to potential kernel exploits, as discussed in [1]. There are no known public exploits at this time, but Linux kernel developers are concerned enough to refuse allowing the capability in the kernel. Singularity enables the capability via a setuid-root function. No OSG VOs require mounting image files via loopback devices with Singularity on worker nodes. They instead use operating system images in directory trees distributed in CVMFS. However, as sites utilize OSG-provided Singularity for non-OSG use cases, we have not changed the upstream default value. Changing the RPM\u2019s default values could potentially cause problems when upgrading between Singularity versions. Sites should balance their understanding of the elevated risk with local use cases when planning any configuration change. WHAT YOU SHOULD DO: Read the \u201cLimiting Image Types\u201d section in the OSG documentation for installing Singularity [2] and decide whether or not to set the number of loopback devices to zero. Note the warning about watching out for singularity.conf.rpmnew after upgrades. Sites should also consider limiting their vulnerability further by installing only the singularity-runtime rpm and not the singularity rpm on worker nodes.

The vulnerability is in the Singularity 'overlay' option. The vulnerability does not enable modifying existing files, it just allows creating new directories and files, but that is sufficient for privilege escalation.

Non setuid-root installations are also not affected. WHAT YOU SHOULD DO: There is no patched version yet. Instead, you should urgently apply the following mitigation: Disable the overlay option by replacing the 'enable overlay' setting in '/etc/singularity/singularity.conf' with 'enable overlay = no'.

A new version is available in the osg-testing repository and is planned to be released to the osg repository on Friday, July 6, after more extensive testing. A workaround not requiring an upgrade is outlined below. IMPACTED VERSIONS: EL7 based systems with singularity versions 2.5.1 and earlier with a default configuration are impacted. EL6 is not affected. WHAT ARE THE VULNERABILITIES: A vulnerability with the singularity mount command enables read access to protected files. In addition, a race condition allows read access to protected files in the root filesystem with other singularity commands. These can lead to privilege escalation. For more details see the singularity-2.5.2 release announcement [1]. Jobs running inside of singularity containers are not able to exploit these vulnerabilities. WHAT YOU SHOULD DO: On EL7 systems, one of the following actions should be applied IMMEDIATELY: 1. Configure the following workaround: set enable overlay = no in /etc/singularity/singularity.conf. No OSG VO using singularity in production currently requires this feature. (This may already be disabled because of a workaround for a previous announced vulnerability [2], which was later fixed.) 2.

There are three new vulnerabilities described in CVE-2018-16947 [1], CVE-2018-16948 [2], and CVE-2018-16949 [3] which have been reported in AFS that could potentially allow an attacker to modify or delete data within the cells that have the backup tape controller (butc) process, could expose information to an attacker, and could cause a Denial of Service (DoS) attack respectively. OSG security team considers patching these vulnerabilities to be IMPORTANT. IMPACTED VERSIONS/ENVIRONMENTS: All releases of OpenAFS server/client prior to 1.6.23 are affected. Also OpenAFS 1.8.0, 1.8.1, and 1.8.1.1 are affected. ACTION RECOMMENDATIONS: Upgrade to 1.8.2 or 1.6.23 releases. Please note that it is necessary to restart OpenAFS for the fixes to take effect. [4] HOW IT WORKS: The backup tape controller process accepts incoming RPCs but does not require (or allow for) authentication of those RPCs. Handling those RPCs results in operations being performed with administrator credentials, including dumping/restoring volume contents and manipulating the backup database. [1] OpenAFS uses the Rx RPC protocol for all remote operations, and uses the rxgen utility to generate the server RPC stubs. Output variables are allocated either on the stack or on the heap, by the RPC handler (for variable-length arrays). Many RPC handlers did not fully initialize these output variables, leaking memory contents to the remote caller for otherwise-successful RPCs. [2] OpenAFS uses the Rx RPC protocol for all remote operations; RPC inputs and outputs are described using the XDR data description language. XDR includes a facility for variable-length (up to 4GB) arrays, optionally subject to a smaller bound on their size. For several RPCs, OpenAFS servers would accept and attempt to unmarshall into memory input arrays up to the full 4GB limit; length and authentication checks in RPC handler functions would be applied only after low-level memory allocation and unmarshalling. This allows unauthenticated attackers to consume large amounts of server memory and network bandwidth, producing service degradation or denial of service to legitimate clients.

VERSIONS IMPACTED: Singularity versions 2.4.0 through 2.6.0 WHAT IS THE VULNERABILITY: This issue affects Singularity 2.4.0 through 2.6.0 on RHEL7 or any modern systemd-based distribution where mount points use shared mount propagation by default (CVE-2018-19295). A malicious user with access to the host system (e.g. SSH or running a payload) could exploit this vulnerability to mount arbitrary directories into the host, resulting in privilege escalation. The vulnerability affects the setuid-root mode of singularity. The RHEL7.6 kernel supports the non-setuid root mode of singularity, but this mode has not yet been sufficiently tested for it to be a recommended workaround at this time. OSG Security considers this vulnerability CRITICAL for sites running Singularity. WHAT YOU SHOULD DO: All sites should install Singularity version 2.6.1 as soon as possible and remove any old versions installed. Singularity 2.6.1 is available in the osg-testing repository; testing is still in progress. Release is planned for later today, December 12. To install from the testing repository, issue the following yum command: yum install --enablerepo=osg-testing singularity The release announcement from the Singularity project mentions a workaround of disabling shared mount propagation, but that adversely affects the visibility of cvmfs automount mount points inside of containers, so we do not recommend it; do the upgrade instead.

A new version with a fix to the vulnerability is being prepared by OSG. The current primary Singularity version supported by OSG, version 2.6.1, is not vulnerable. OSG does however support a 3.x.x version in the osg-upcoming yum repository and some sites have installed it. We will send a follow up announcement when a new version is available, but meanwhile there is a mitigation, below. WHAT YOU SHOULD DO: If you are using privileged Singularity 3.x.x on a RHEL7-based distribution, while waiting for the new version either downgrade to version 2.6.1 or enable unprivileged Singularity [1] and set allow setuid = no in singularity.conf. If you are using Singularity 3.x.x on a RHEL6-based distribution, downgrade to version 2.6.1. HOW IT WORKS: A malicious user with local/network access to the host system (e.g. ssh) could exploit this vulnerability due to insecure permissions allowing a user to edit files within /run/singularity/instances/sing/ / .

OSG has released a version of frontier-squid with fixes for the vulnerabilities. All installations of squid should be upgraded. OSG security considers the vulnerability affecting reverse proxy installations (such as CVMFS Stratum 1 servers) to be CRITICAL and the vulnerability affecting ordinary proxy installations to be MODERATE. IMPACTED VERSIONS: All versions of frontier-squid prior to 4.10-1.1 WHAT ARE THE VULNERABILITIES: The first vulnerability [1] affects reverse proxy configurations, where squid forwards all traffic to a backend server using the http_port \"accel\" or \"vhost\" options. CVMFS Stratum 1 servers are affected. Due to incorrect input validation, squid can interpret crafted HTTP requests in unexpected ways to access server resources prohibited by earlier security filters. Also, due to incorrect buffer management a remote client can cause a buffer overflow in a Squid acting as reverse-proxy. This can result in remote code execution. The second vulnerability [2] affects squid installations that allow proxying ftp, which is the default. Due to incorrect data management, squid is vulnerable to information disclosure when translating FTP server listings into HTTP responses. The information may be anything from the heap area including information from other processes on the machine. An exploit requires control of the destination server, so those installations that restrict the destination servers to a known list of trusted servers should not be affected, but OSG security still advises upgrading.

All OSG VOs (including WLCG VOs) that use singularity are now configured to run singularity unprivileged out of CVMFS when they can. OSG security believes this to be a significantly lower risk than having singularity installed with setuid root enabled. We recommend that sites enable unprivileged user namespaces on their RHEL 7 worker nodes if they haven\u2019t, and remove singularity rpms if there is no non-OSG requirement to keep them. IMPACTED VERSIONS: RHEL 7.6 and later are affected. RHEL 8 has unprivileged user namespaces enabled by default. RHEL 6 cannot enable unprivileged user namespaces. WHAT ARE THE VULNERABILITIES: There are no known current exploits with setuid root singularity, but there have been in the past. Setuid root programs are notoriously difficult to secure, and there are likely to be more exploits discovered in the future. WHAT YOU SHOULD DO: On RHEL 7 worker nodes, enable unprivileged user namespaces by following the instructions on the OSG singularity installation page [1]. Then, if you have no requirement to keep the rpm installed for non-OSG purposes, remove singularity rpms from your worker nodes. If your singularity installation is version 2, instead remove singularity-runtime rpms. If you have to keep the singularity rpm installed, consider setting the configuration \u2018allow setuid = no\u2019. More information on making that choice is available [2].

The HTCondor v8.9.11 release contains fixes for both the vulnerabilities. The OSG Security team considers this vulnerability to be of HIGH severity. IMPACTED VERSIONS: HTCondor version 8.9.2 through 8.9.10. WHAT ARE THE VULNERABILITIES: CVE-2021-25312: when a user is authenticating to a daemon using IDTOKENS it is possible for them to impersonate other users and/or the \"condor\" service itself. [3] CVE-2021-25311: a running condor_credd daemon can be instructed to create or write certain files as root that are outside of the directory specified by the parameter \"SEC_CREDENTIAL_DIRECTORY_OAUTH\". If you have not added the CREDD to your DAEMON_LIST, you are not vulnerable to this issue. (Keep in mind the CREDD is automatically added to the DAEMON_LIST if you have added \"use feature:OAUTH\").

The OSG Security team recommends applying these updates, especially if the mitigation steps recommended previously have not been implemented. ORIGINAL ANNOUNCEMENT: There are three new vulnerabilities in the iSCSI kernel subsystem described in CVE-2021-27363 [1], CVE-2021-27364 [2] and CVE-2021-27365 [3] that could allow local privilege escalation to root. The OSG Security team considers these vulnerabilities to be of HIGH severity and highly recommend patching your Linux kernel once the updates are available; in the meantime, a mitigation is available and we recommend applying this mitigation if possible. IMPACTED VERSIONS: RedHat-based distributions (RHEL 7, 8, and derivatives) which were installed with GUI, Workstation, or Virtualization Host Debian-based distributions with iSCSI hardware or manual iSCSI setups WHAT ARE THE VULNERABILITIES: A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A heap buffer overflow in the iSCSI subsystem is triggered by setting an iSCSI string attribute to a value larger than one page and then trying to read it. [3] These three vulnerabilities can lead to local elevation of privileges, information leaks, and denials of service. WHAT YOU SHOULD DO: At present, no updates are available for RHEL 7, 8 or their derivatives. The OSG Security team recommends sites carry out the following mitigation on hosts to which users have shell access, including worker nodes and submit hosts. The libiscsi module will be auto-loaded when required, its use can be disabled by preventing the module from loading with the following instructions: # echo \"install libiscsi /bin/true\" >> /etc/modprobe.d/disable-libiscsi.conf The system will need to be restarted if the libiscsi modules are loaded.

The OSG yum repository now contains the patched version frontier-squid-4.15-1.2. All sites should upgrade. The difference between version 4.15-1.1 and 4.15-1.2 is minor, and if you already upgraded to 4.15-1.1 from osg-testing you do not need to upgrade again. FIRST UPDATE: This is a followup to the announcement earlier today about vulnerabilities in Squid. We received feedback that the \"WHAT YOU SHOULD DO\" wording was ambiguous. We intended to recommend that everyone watch for and upgrade to frontier-squid-4.15-1.1 once it became available, but it could be read that that advice was only for Squids that had restricted destinations. The intended advice was only to limit the workaround to those with the highest risk and for everyone else to wait for the new version which was expected soon. In the meanwhile, the new frontier-squid version has already become available in the osg-testing yum repository if you want to upgrade immediately. We will send another announcement when it becomes available in the OSG (production) repository. ORIGINAL ANNOUNCEMENT: Multiple security vulnerabilities in Squid have been publicly announced [1]. The most important one allows bypassing access controls and the others enable Denial of Service attacks. The OSG Security team considers the HTTP Request Smuggling vulnerability to be of HIGH severity. IMPACTED VERSIONS: All frontier-squid versions prior to 4.15-1.1 are impacted. All Squid versions from Red Hat have the Denial of Service vulnerabilities, but the most important vulnerability was fixed in squid-3.5.20-17.el7_9.6 [2]. WHAT ARE THE VULNERABILITIES: The most important vulnerability is that due to improper input validation Squid is vulnerable to an HTTP Request Smuggling attack when there is whitespace in a URL. This enables anyone to bypass all access controls if they have access to read anything through the Squid. This especially impacts any Squids that restrict destination URLs, which is not the case for most site Squids, but it might also enable access to cache manager functions which are blocked by default. The other vulnerabilities are potential Denial of Service vulnerabilities. The worst of those should already be blocked in most installations by their denial of the URN protocol. WHAT YOU SHOULD DO: If you use frontier-squid and restrict the destination, as soon as possible update customize.sh with the following line and either reload or restart frontier-squid: setoption(\"uri_whitespace\", \"deny\") In addition, watch for a follow up announcement on the availability of frontier-squid-4.15-1.1 and upgrade to that version when it is available. If you use the Red Hat EL7 Squid, update to squid-3.5.20-17.el7_9.6 and watch for further updates from Red Hat fixing the Denial of Service vulnerabilities.

IMPACTED VERSIONS: Any java based web service running a Log4j version prior to 2.15.0. WHAT ARE THE VULNERABILITIES: Any java-based web service that uses log4j for logging is potentially vulnerable to a remote code execution flaw which allows a remote attacker to execute a remote payload with a simple command. A list of known affected services is being compiled [2], at present this includes Apache Solr, Druid, Flink, as well as Logstash, ElasticSearch, and Kafka. The full attack surface has not yet been identified. At this point we do not believe the OSG software stack, dCache, or VOMS admin to be vulnerable to this attack. WHAT YOU SHOULD DO: As soon as possible, identify any services running log4j affected versions and update to version 2.15.0 or higher [3][4][5]. If you are using a version older than 2.15.0 and cannot upgrade a temporary mitigation may be available [6].

The OSG security team considers the risk of this vulnerability to be MODERATE. IMPACTED VERSIONS: Any version of singularity compiled using golang 1.16.11 or older or using 1.17 through 1.17.4 is impacted. This includes EPEL singularity rpms 3.8.5-1 or earlier. WHAT ARE THE VULNERABILITIES: Prior to golang 1.16.12 and 1.17.5, the syscall.ForkExec function had a flaw that can result in output for one file descriptor to be redirected to another under conditions of running out of file descriptors [1]. Singularity uses that library call, so it is potentially affected [2]. There is no specific known exploit at this time, but especially for setuid-root installations it is better to ensure that a newly compiled version is installed. WHAT YOU SHOULD DO: Upgrade to a version of singularity compiled with the newer golang.

An attacker with a local account on the system can crash the system or escalate their privileges. IMPACTED VERSIONS: Linux kernel 5.4 through 5.6.10; Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.3 GA and later. Note: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 distributions are not affected. WHAT ARE THE VULNERABILITIES: This flaw allows a local attacker with a user account on the system to gain access to out-of-bounds memory, leading to a system crash or a privilege escalation threat. A working exploit is publicly available. WHAT YOU SHOULD DO: Update your OS to a patched version of the Linux kernel when it is available for your distribution [3][4][5]. Note: Currently there are no patched kernel packages for RHEL 8. MITIGATIONS: The mitigation for RHEL 8 derived distributions is to prevent unprivileged users from running unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER) or unshare(CLONE_NEWNET). This can be done with the command: $ echo 0 > /proc/sys/user/max_user_namespaces You can make this change persistent by adding the following line to a file in the \"/etc/sysctl.d/\" directory: user.max_user_namespaces = 0 The system configuration files need to be reloaded for the changes to take effect. To reload the contents of the files, run the following command: $ sudo sysctl --system Note: User namespaces are used primarily for Linux containers. If containers are in use, the above fix is not applicable. The mitigation for containers can be achieved by blocking the pertinent syscalls in a seccomp policy file.

We are not aware of any examples of the vulnerability being present in OSG systems or software. Our partners at the EGI Software Vulnerability Group sent out a message about this issue, so we've decided to also relay the details about CVE-2023-0286. In OpenSSL there is a type confusion vulnerability relating to X.400 address processing inside an X.509 GeneralName. X.400 addresses were parsed as an ASN1_STRING but the public structure definition for GENERAL_NAME incorrectly specified the type of the x400Address field as ASN1_TYPE. This field is subsequently interpreted by the OpenSSL function GENERAL_NAME_cmp as an ASN1_TYPE rather than an ASN1_STRING. [1] IMPACTED VERSIONS: OpenSSL versions 3.0, 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 are vulnerable to this issue. WHAT ARE THE VULNERABILITIES: When CRL checking is enabled (for example, the application sets the X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK flag), this vulnerability may allow an attacker to pass arbitrary pointers to a memcmp call, enabling them to read memory contents or cause a denial of service. In most cases, the attack requires the attacker to provide both the certificate chain and CRL, of which neither needs a valid signature. If the attacker only controls one of these inputs, the other input must already contain an X.400 address as a CRL distribution point, which is uncommon. In this case, this vulnerability is likely only to affect applications that have implemented their own functionality for retrieving CRLs over a network. [2] RedHat have stated they aren't aware of any software in their distributions that are affected by this vulnerability, and that the vulnerability is likely to only affect applications that have implemented their own functionality for retrieving CRLs over a network. [3] WHAT YOU SHOULD DO: No actions are required at this time. Updated openssl packages are NOT available for RHEL based distributions yet.

There is an ext4 use-after-free flaw described in CVE-2022-1184 [3][4][5][6] that is exploitable through versions of Apptainer < 1.1.0, installations that include apptainer-suid < 1.1.8, and all versions of Singularity in their default configurations on older operating systems where that CVE has not been patched. That includes Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, Debian 10 buster (unless the linux-5.10 package is installed), Ubuntu 18.04 bionic and Ubuntu 20.04 focal. Additional details can be found in the Apptainer advisory in reference [1] below. WHAT YOU SHOULD DO: Review the Apptainer advisory [1] and update Apptainer to v1.1.8. Sites that are using setuid-root mode on RHEL7 should update urgently. The updated packages can be found on the Apptainer github repository [2], and are available in the epel-testing repository for distributions that can make use of EPEL. The following workarounds are also available: Either do not install apptainer-suid (for versions 1.1.0 through 1.1.7) or set allow setuid = no in apptainer.conf (or singularity.conf for singularity versions). This requires having unprivileged user namespaces enabled and except for apptainer 1.1.x versions will disallow mounting of sif files, extfs files, and squashfs files in addition to other, less significant impacts. (Encrypted sif files are also not supported unprivileged in apptainer 1.1.x.) Alternatively, use the \"limit containers\" options in apptainer.conf/singularity.conf to limit sif files to trusted users, groups, and/or paths. (The option \"allow container extfs = no\" disallows mounting extfs overlay files but does not disallow mounting of extfs overlay partitions inside SIF files, so it does not help work around the problem.)

(Encrypted sif files are also not supported unprivileged in apptainer 1.1.x.) Alternatively, use the \"limit containers\" options in apptainer.conf/singularity.conf to limit sif files to trusted users, groups, and/or paths. (The option \"allow container extfs = no\" disallows mounting extfs overlay files but does not disallow mounting of extfs overlay partitions inside SIF files, so it does not help work around the problem.)

UPDATED INFO: additional similar ext4 vulnerabilities have been discovered that are not yet patched on most operating systems including RHEL8, RHEL9, Debian 11, and Ubuntu 22.04.","title":"WHAT ARE THE VULNERABILITIES:"},{"location":"vulns/OSG-SEC-2023-05-31/#what-you-should-do","text":"Review the Apptainer advisory [2] and update Apptainer to v1.1.8. UPDATED INFO: All sites that are using setuid-root mode in Singularity or Apptainer should update urgently. The updated packages can be found on the Apptainer github repository [3], and are available in the epel-testing repository for distributions that can make use of EPEL. The following workarounds are also available: Either do not install apptainer-suid (for versions 1.1.0 through 1.1.7) or set allow setuid = no in apptainer.conf (or singularity.conf for singularity versions). This requires having unprivileged user namespaces enabled and except for apptainer 1.1.x versions will disallow mounting of sif files, extfs files, and squashfs files in addition to other, less significant impacts. (Encrypted sif files are also not supported unprivileged in apptainer 1.1.x.) Alternatively, use the \"limit containers\" options in apptainer.conf/singularity.conf to limit sif files to trusted users, groups, and/or paths. (The option \"allow container extfs = no\" disallows mounting extfs overlay files but does not disallow mounting of extfs overlay partitions inside SIF files, so it does not help work around the problem.)","title":"WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:"},{"location":"vulns/OSG-SEC-2023-05-31/#references","text":"[1] https://osg-htc.org/security/vulns/OSG-SEC-2023-04-26/ [2] https://github.com/apptainer/apptainer/security/advisories/GHSA-j4rf-7357-f4cg [3] https://github.com/apptainer/apptainer/releases/tag/v1.1.8 [4] https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-1184 [5] https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2022-1184 [6] https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-1184 [7] https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2022-1184 Please contact the OSG security team at security@osg-htc.org if you have any questions or concerns.

For any systems or developers using Go we strongly recommend that the available patches be applied. The CVEs are as follows: CVE-2023-29402 (go command may generate unexpected code at build time when using cgo), CVE-2023-29403 (runtime: unexpected behavior of setuid/setgid binaries), CVE-2023-29404 (go command may execute arbitrary code at build time when using cgo), and CVE-2023-29405 (Arbitrary code execution triggered by linker flags). IMPACTED VERSIONS: CVE-2023-29402: RHEL 7,8,9 based distributions CVE-2023-29403: RHEL 7,8,9 based distributions CVE-2023-29404: RHEL 7,8,9 based distributions CVE-2023-29405: RHEL 7,8,9 based distributions Go 1.19.x versions before 1.19.10 Go 1.20.x versions before 1.20.5 WHAT ARE THE VULNERABILITIES: CVE-2023-29402: The go command may generate unexpected code at build time when using cgo. This may result in unexpected behavior when running a go program which uses cgo. This may occur when running an untrusted module which contains directories with newline characters in their names. Modules which are retrieved using the go command, i.e. via \"go get\", are not affected (modules retrieved using GOPATH-mode, i.e. GO111MODULE=off, may be affected). [3][7] CVE-2023-29403: On Unix platforms, the Go runtime does not behave differently when a binary is run with the setuid/setgid bits. This can be dangerous in certain cases, such as when dumping memory state, or assuming the status of standard i/o file descriptors. If a setuid/setgid binary is executed with standard I/O file descriptors closed, opening any files can result in unexpected content being read or written with elevated privileges. Similarly, if a setuid/setgid program is terminated, either via panic or signal, it may leak the contents of its registers. [4][8] CVE-2023-29404: The go command may execute arbitrary code at build time when using cgo. This may occur when running \"go get\" on a malicious module, or when running any other command which builds untrusted code. This is can be triggered by linker flags, specified via a \"#cgo LDFLAGS\" directive. The arguments for a number of flags which are non-optional are incorrectly considered optional, allowing disallowed flags to be smuggled through the LDFLAGS sanitization. This affects usage of both the gc and gccgo compilers. [5][9] CVE-2023-29405: The go command may execute arbitrary code at build time when using cgo. This may occur when running \"go get\" on a malicious module, or when running any other command which builds untrusted code. This is can be triggered by linker flags, specified via a \"#cgo LDFLAGS\" directive. Flags containing embedded spaces are mishandled, allowing disallowed flags to be smuggled through the LDFLAGS sanitization by including them in the argument of another flag. This only affects usage of the gccgo compiler. [6][10] WHAT YOU SHOULD DO: For RHEL 7 based distributions: golang comes from EPEL. It should be available in epel-testing by the weekend and in epel in about another week. Install these updates when they become available. For RHEL 8 based distributions: An update for the go-toolset:rhel8 module is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8. Install these updates. You can find a full list of the updated packages in the RHEL 8 security announcement errata [1]. For RHEL 9 based distributions: An update for go-toolset and golang is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9. Install these updates. You can find a full list of the updated packages in the RHEL 8 security announcement errata [2]. If you are using your own builds of Go 1.19.x or 1.20.x, upgrade to versions 1.19.10 or 1.20.5 or higher respectively. Software that has been compiled with the unpatched versions of the Go tools should be recompiled after the updated versions have been installed.

Please see the details below. IMPACTED VERSIONS: RHEL 7, 8, 9 and all RHEL based distributions. WHAT ARE THE VULNERABILITIES: The following CVEs affect RHEL7, RHEL8 & RHEL9: CVE-2023-35001 - An out-of-bounds (OOB) memory access flaw was found in the Netfilter module in the Linux kernel's nft_byteorder_eval in net/netfilter/nft_byteorder.c. A bound check failure allows a local attacker with CAP_NET_ADMIN access to cause a local privilege escalation issue due to incorrect data alignment. [1] CVE-2023-3776 - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in fw_set_parms in net/sched/cls_fw.c in the network scheduler sub-component in the Linux Kernel. This issue occurs due to a missing sanity check during cleanup at the time of failure, leading to a misleading reference. This may allow a local attacker to gain local privilege escalation. [2] CVE-2023-20593 - Zenbleed AMD Zen 2 CPU data leak. [3] The following CVEs affect RHEL8 & RHEL9: CVE-2023-3390 - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Netfilter subsystem of the Linux kernel when processing named and anonymous sets in batch requests, which can lead to performing arbitrary reads and writes in kernel memory. This flaw allows a local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability to crash or potentially escalate their privileges on the system. [4] CVE-2023-4004 - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's netfilter in the way a user triggers the nft_pipapo_remove function with the element, without a NFT_SET_EXT_KEY_END. This issue could allow a local user to crash the system or potentially escalate their privileges on the system. [5] CVE-2023-21102 - A vulnerability was found in the __efi_rt_asm_wrapper of the efi-rt-wrapper.S in the Linux kernel, where there is a possible bypass of shadow stack protection due to a logic error in the code. This flaw could lead to local escalation of privilege without additional execution privileges needed. [6] CVE-2023-1637 - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel X86 CPU Power management when resuming CPU from suspend-to-RAM. This issue could allow a local user unauthorized access to memory from the CPU. [7] The following CVEs affect RHEL9 only: CVE-2023-3610 - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in the netfilter: nf_tables component in the Linux kernel due to a missing error handling in the abort path of NFT_MSG_NEWRULE. This flaw allows a local attacker with CAP_NET_ADMIN access capability to cause a local privilege escalation problem. [8] CVE-2023-4147 - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel\u2019s Netfilter functionality when adding a rule with NFTA_RULE_CHAIN_ID. This flaw allows a local user to crash or escalate their privileges on the system. [9] CVE-2023-31248 - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Netfilter module in net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c in nft_chain_lookup_byid. This flaw allows a local attacker to cause a local privilege escalation issue due to a missing cleanup. [10] WHAT YOU SHOULD DO: Sites running RHEL7 are recommended to carry out mitigation, unless this disables functionality required, again see references below. Sites running RHEL8 are also recommended to update relevant components, as most of the vulnerabilities affecting RHEL8 have also been fixed. Sites running RHEL9 and derivatives are recommended to update relevant components as soon as possible, when a patched version is available see references below.

[1] [2] [3] This is a critical issue for all sites that are using Slurm built with PMIx support. IMPACTED VERSIONS: OpenPMIx PMIx before 4.2.6 and 5.0.x before 5.0.1 WHAT ARE THE VULNERABILITIES: CVE-2023-41915 A filesystem race condition could permit a malicious user to obtain ownership of an arbitrary file on the filesystem when parts of the PMIx library is called by a process running as uid 0. This may happen under the default configuration of certain workload managers, including Slurm. [1] WHAT YOU SHOULD DO: First check if Slurm was built with PMIx support by running: $ srun --mpi=list Typical output will be something like MPI plugin types are... cray_shasta none pmi2 pmix specific pmix plugin versions available: pmix_v3,pmix_v4 This will tell you whether Slurm is built with PMIx support and if so which version of PMIx. If the command returns no pmix option, your Slurm installation can be assumed to be unaffected by this CVE. Otherwise, upgrade PMIx to the fixed releases v4.2.6 or v5.0.1 [1]. Note that there is at least one ABI-breaking change between versions 4.2.3 and 4.2.6, which means that upgrading to 4.2.6 requires Slurm packages to be rebuilt. If Slurm upgrade isn't an option, you can disable PMIx support by removing the mpi_pmix*.so libraries on the compute nodes and adjusting the MpiDefault setting in your Slurm configuration. You can also patch your current PMIx version by replacing the chown function with lchown in the source and rebuilding the PMIx rpm [4]. After installing the patched PMIx, this command shouldn't return any result: objdump -t /usr/lib64/libpmi*.so* | grep chown After the installation, slurmd on the compute nodes needs to be restarted. Note that all versions prior to PMIx 4.2.6 are vulnerable, but some older PMIx versions are no longer supported and will not be patched.
